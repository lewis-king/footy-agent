The Gunners seek to close the gap on leaders Liverpool while aiming to extend their 13-match unbeaten league run.

This matchup features contrasting styles - Arsenal's organized pressing system against City's possession-dominant approach.

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Arsenal vs. Manchester City Premier League match. First, I need to parse all the provided search results to gather relevant data.\n\nStarting with the match overview. The latest encounter between these two was on February 2, 2025, where Arsenal won 5-1. That's a significant result, so I should highlight that as a revenge match, especially after the 2-2 draw earlier in the season. Both teams have title aspirations, but according to the search results, Arsenal is closer to Liverpool, while City is struggling a bit this season.\n\nNext, team news. From the search results, Arsenal has several injuries: Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Ben White, Takehiro Tomiyasu, and Raheem Sterling. On the other hand, City is missing key players like Rodri, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, and Jeremy Doku. However, Kevin De Bruyne and John Stones might be fit. Need to structure this into injuries, suspensions, returnees, and projected lineups. The lineups from the previous match on February 2nd can be a reference, but check the latest updates. For example, Arsenal's lineup in the 5-1 win had Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly, Partey, Rice, Odegaard, Martinelli, Havertz, Trossard. City had Ortega, Nunes, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol, Kovacic, Bernardo, Savinho, Marmoush, Foden, Haaland. Maybe adjust based on recent news.\n\nAsian handicap analysis. The user provided a line of 0.25 with home odds 2.05 and away 1.85. From the stats in search results, Arsenal's form at home is strong (5 wins in last 10 home matches), while City's away form is mixed. Also, Arsenal's recent head-to-head against City has improved, being unbeaten in the last three meetings. The Asian handicap table would compare form, H2H, home/away stats. Arsenal's value seems better here due to home advantage and City's defensive injuries.\n\nKey player matchups. Highlight \u00d8degaard vs. Kovacic in midfield, given \u00d8degaard's impact in the last game. Havertz against Stones and Akanji, since Havertz scored and assisted in the 5-1 win. Also, Foden's form (6 goals in January) against Arsenal's defense. Lewis-Skelly's rising influence as a young player.\n\nBetting insights. Match result leans towards Arsenal given their home form and City's injuries. Over/under could be over 2.5 goals based on their last meeting and City's defensive issues. Both teams to score is likely, considering both have attacking firepower but defensive vulnerabilities.\n\nPrediction. Based on the 5-1 result and current form, maybe a 2-1 Arsenal win. Confidence level around 7/10 due to City's potential to bounce back but hampered by injuries.\n\nNow, structuring all this into the required JSON format. Ensure all fields are filled with data from search results, properly cited. Check for any inconsistencies, like conflicting injury reports. Make sure the projected lineups align with the latest available info. Verify stats like possession, shots, etc., from the search results. Finally, cross-check the JSON structure to match the user's specified schema.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Arsenal host Manchester City in a pivotal Premier League clash with major implications for both the title race and top-four battle.
