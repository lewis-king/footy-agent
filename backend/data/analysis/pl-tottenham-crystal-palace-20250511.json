Spurs, sitting mid-table with inconsistent form (3 wins in last 5 league games), face a Palace side boasting average away form (6 wins in 17 road games) but fresh off a Europa League semi-final first leg victory[4][11].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Tottenham vs Crystal Palace Premier League match on May 11, 2025. Let me start by going through the provided search results and extracting the necessary information.\n\nFirst, the **match_overview** should include team form, recent performances, and context. From the search results, Tottenham's recent form is mixed with 3 wins in their last 5 games but struggling defensively, conceding 61 goals last season. Crystal Palace is 12th with 11 wins, 13 draws, and 11 losses. Their away form is average. Head-to-head stats show Tottenham has dominated with 17 wins out of 25 meetings. Recent simulations from Dimers (source [2]) give Tottenham a 40.9% chance to win, Palace 35.9%, and a 23.2% chance for a draw. Also, both teams have high xG stats, with Tottenham's home matches averaging 3.71 goals (source [14]), and Palace's away games averaging 2.82 goals (source [10]). This suggests a high-scoring game.\n\nNext, **asian_handicap_analysis**. The line is +0.0 with Tottenham at 2.04 and Palace at 1.9. The Asian Handicap market here is about picking the team to win with no handicap. The key is to compare the implied probability of the odds with the model's prediction. Tottenham's 2.04 odds imply a 49% chance, but models (source [2]) suggest around 40.9%, which is lower. However, some sources like [1] mention that the actual probability for Tottenham's Asian Hcp 0.0 is between 55-60%, suggesting value. But there's a conflict here. Wait, source [1] says bookies have Tottenham at +162.5 (which is decimal odds around 2.63) for a win, but the user-provided Asian Handicap odds are 2.04. Maybe the discrepancy is because the Asian Handicap is different from the straight win market. Need to clarify. The user provided Asian Handicap Line: +0.0, which is essentially a draw no bet. If the line is 0.0, then the bet is on Tottenham to win, and if it's a draw, the stake is refunded. The odds for Tottenham here are 2.04, implying a 49% probability. However, the model from [2] gives Tottenham a 40.9% chance, which is lower. But source [1] suggests that their model sees a 55-60% probability for Tottenham at 0.0 handicap, which would make 2.04 odds valuable. This inconsistency needs resolving. Maybe the user's provided odds are for the 0.0 line, and the model in [1] considers value there. So, if the bookmaker's implied probability is 49% (1/2.04), but the model suggests 55-60%, that's a value bet. Hence, recommending Tottenham on the Asian Handicap 0.0.\n\nFor **key_player_matchups**, looking at injuries is crucial. Tottenham's Maddison and Bergvall are out (sources [4][16]), while Crystal Palace's Wharton is out (source [17]). Key players: Mathys Tel for Tottenham, who has 2 goals in 5 games (source [1]), and Jean-Philippe Mateta for Palace, who has been scoring. The matchup between Tel and Palace's defense (which has conceded 1.48 xG against away) could be critical. Also, Palace's Isma\u00efla Sarr hasn't had a shot on target in 7 away games (source [1]), so his under on shots might be a prop bet.\n\n**team_news**: Tottenham's injuries include Maddison (knee, out for season [4]), Bergvall (ankle [16]), but Solanke might return (source [4]). Crystal Palace's Wharton is out (source [17]), with other injuries listed in [5]. Using the predicted lineups provided by the user, but need to check if they're in the search results. The user provided lineups aren't in the sources, so I'll use the ones mentioned in the query.\n\n**betting_insights**: \n1. Over 2.5 goals: Both teams have high xG and recent matches with over 2.5 goals. Source [7] mentions 12 of Tottenham's home games had BTTS + over 2.5, and Palace's away games average 2.82 goals. Odds for over 2.5 are +125 (source [8]), which is 2.25 decimal. Implied probability is 44.4%, but the actual probability is higher based on stats, so value here.\n2. Mathys Tel Anytime Goalscorer: He's scored recently, and odds are +260 (source [1]), which is 3.60 decimal. If his xG is good, this could be value.\n3. Both Teams to Score: 57% of Palace's away games have BTTS (source [10]), and Tottenham's home games have 76% BTTS (source [14]). Odds around 1.80 (implied 55.6%) vs actual probability higher, so value.\n\n**prediction**: Considering injuries and form, a 2-1 win for Tottenham. They have home advantage and Palace's missing Wharton. Confidence 7/10.\n\n**my_say**: Need to craft an engaging narrative, highlighting the stakes, key absences, and potential for goals. Mention the tactical battle between Postecoglou and Glasner, the impact of injuries, and the importance of Tel and Mateta.\n\nCitations: Ensure every fact is backed by the search results, using [n] notation. For example, Maddison's injury is from [4], Palace's xG from [10], etc.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Tottenham host Crystal Palace in a Premier League clash with significant implications for European qualification.
