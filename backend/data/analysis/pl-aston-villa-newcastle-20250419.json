    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Aston Villa vs Newcastle match. First, I need to go through all the provided search results to gather relevant data. \n\nStarting with the form tables, search result [1] shows Newcastle top of the form table with 15 points from their last five matches, including a big win over Palace. Aston Villa's form isn't as strong, but they did have a recent comeback in the Champions League. That's important context for the match overview.\n\nNext, the head-to-head stats from [3] and [8] indicate Newcastle has a historical edge with 13 wins out of 30 meetings. Recent H2H from [8] mentions Aston Villa won 3 of the last 5, but Newcastle won the last two. This could influence the Asian Handicap analysis.\n\nLooking at team news, the user provided predicted lineups, so I need to structure that into the team_news section. Injuries and suspensions aren't explicitly mentioned in the search results, so I might have to infer or note that there's no specific info from the sources. However, [3] lists some players in the lineups, which I can cross-reference.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap, [4] mentions a Home -1.25 with 29% probability, but the current line is +0.0. The analysis needs to compare form, H2H, and home/away performance. Newcastle's away form is strong, as per [1], and their recent wins against top teams like Man Utd and Leicester support their momentum. Villa's home strength from [2] (no home loss since October) is a counterpoint. The odds from [5] show Villa as slight favorites, but the value might be on Newcastle given their form.\n\nKey player matchups: Alexander Isak's scoring form (21 goals) from [3] against Villa's defense. Also, Ollie Watkins for Villa has 14 goals. Their duel could be pivotal. Midfield battle between Guimar\u00e3es and Kamara might control the game tempo.\n\nBetting insights: Over 2.5 goals seems likely given both teams' recent trends ([2], [4], [5]). Isak anytime scorer based on his form. Asian Handicap value on Newcastle +0.0 at 2.04 odds, considering their form edge.\n\nPrediction: Newcastle might edge it 2-1, considering their attacking form and Villa's potential fatigue from midweek. Confidence level around 7/10.\n\nIn 'my_say', highlight the clash of styles, Newcastle's momentum, and the significance for Champions League spots. Maybe mention the tactical duel between Emery and Howe.\n\nNeed to ensure all citations are correctly referenced. For example, form stats from [1], H2H from [3][8], goal stats from [3], etc. Also, check that all data points are from the provided sources and not prior knowledge.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This high-stakes Premier League clash sees third-place Newcastle (18-9-5) visit seventh-place Aston Villa (15-8-9) at Villa Park in a critical battle for European qualification.
