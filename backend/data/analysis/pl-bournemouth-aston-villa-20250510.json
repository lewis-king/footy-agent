Bournemouth are unbeaten in five matches, including a controversial 2-1 win at Arsenal, while Villa have won six of their last seven league games[1][5]. Both teams need maximum points - Bournemouth to secure Conference League qualification and Villa to maintain their slim Champions League hopes[1][12]. Historically, Villa edge H2H with 6 wins to Bournemouth's 5, but the Cherries have scored late equalizers in two of the last three meetings[1][14].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Bournemouth vs Aston Villa. First, I need to structure the response according to the user's guidelines. The user wants a detailed JSON output with specific sections like match_overview, asian_handicap_analysis, etc. \n\nStarting with the match_overview. The user mentioned using live-sourced info, so I'll check the search results. From [1], Bournemouth is eighth with 53 points, Villa seventh with 60. Bournemouth is unbeaten in five, including a win over Arsenal. Villa has six wins in seven. The H2H from [1] says Villa has six wins, Bournemouth five. Recent form is crucial here.\n\nNext, team_news. The predicted lineups were provided in the query, but I need to source injuries and suspensions from the search results. [8] mentions Villa's Youri Tielemans out with a muscular injury. [9] lists the predicted lineups for both teams. Bournemouth's lineup includes Kepa, Huijsen, Zabarnyi, etc. Villa's lineup has Martinez, Cash, Konsa, etc. So I'll structure the injuries and suspensions based on that. For example, Tielemans is injured, and no suspensions are mentioned in the sources, so maybe leave that empty or state none.\n\nFor asian_handicap_analysis, the line is +0.0 with home odds 1.86 and away 2.09. From the search results, [4] gives Bournemouth a 35.1% chance, Villa 41%. The Asian Handicap here is level, so it's about which team is more likely to win. The user mentioned value when the bookmaker's odds are higher than the model's implied probability. Villa's odds are 2.09 (47.8% implied), but the model says 41% (which is lower?), wait, maybe I need to check. Wait, the user's example was when the model's probability is higher than the bookmaker's implied. So if the model says Villa has a 41% chance, the implied odds should be around 2.44 (1/0.41). But the bookmaker offers 2.09, which implies 47.8% (1/2.09). So that would mean the model thinks Villa's chance is lower than the bookmaker's implied, so maybe no value there. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck. If the model says Villa has a 41% chance to win, the fair odds would be 1/0.41 \u2248 2.44. But the bookmaker offers 2.09, which is lower than 2.44, meaning the bookmaker thinks Villa has a higher chance (47.8%). So according to the model, Villa is overvalued by the bookmaker, so maybe there's no value in backing Villa. Conversely, Bournemouth's 35.1% model probability would imply odds of 2.85, but the bookmaker offers 1.86 (53.8% implied), so the model thinks Bournemouth's chance is lower than the bookmaker's implied. Hmm, maybe the value is on Villa? Wait, I'm getting mixed up. The user's example was when the model's probability is higher than the bookmaker's implied. So if the model says 41% and the bookmaker's odds imply 47.8%, then the model thinks the true probability is lower, so the bookmaker's odds are shorter than they should be. Therefore, backing Villa wouldn't be a value bet. But maybe there's another angle. Alternatively, maybe the Asian Handicap line is even, so considering the supremacy. From [12], Opta's model gives Bournemouth a 40.7% chance, Villa 41%. The line being 0.0 suggests it's a toss-up. But Villa's recent form is better. The analysis should consider recent form, xG, etc. From [3], in their last meeting, Villa had higher xG (2.38 vs 1.81). Also, Villa's away form is decent with three wins in six away matches [6]. Bournemouth's home form is mixed. So maybe Villa has a slight edge, making the Asian Handicap away 0.0 a value bet at 2.09 if the model suggests they have a higher chance than implied.\n\nKey_player_matchups: Look for key players from both teams. For Bournemouth, Evanilson scored the winner against Arsenal [1]. For Villa, Ollie Watkins is a threat, with assists against Bournemouth [14]. Also, the midfield battle between Bournemouth's Cook and Villa's Kamara could be crucial. From [10], Kamara is part of Villa's midfield. \n\nBetting_insights: From [5], both teams to score is likely, as seven of Bournemouth's last nine games had BTTS. Also, Villa has scored in 11 straight league games [6]. The over 2.5 goals is supported by Villa's away games having over 2.5 in six of their last seven [6]. The correct score prediction from [6] is 1-2 Villa. The user wants value opportunities, so maybe BTTS and over 2.5 goals. Also, looking at the Asian Handicap, maybe Villa 0.0 at 2.09 is a value if the model's probability is higher than implied. Wait, the model from [4] says Villa has a 41% chance, which is higher than the 35.1% for Bournemouth. The draw is 23.8%. So the Asian Handicap 0.0 for Villa at 2.09 implies a 47.8% chance, but the model says 41%, so perhaps it's not a value. Alternatively, maybe the model from [12] gives Villa a 41% chance, but Opta's model [12] says Bournemouth 40.7%, Villa 41.0%. So very close. If the bookmaker's odds for Villa are 2.09 (47.8% implied), but the model says 41%, then it's overvalued. So maybe the value is on Bournemouth +0.0 at 1.86, which implies 53.8%, but the model says 35.1% + 23.8% (draw) = 58.9% for Bournemouth not losing. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the Asian Handicap 0.0 is essentially a pick'em, so if the model thinks it's close, but Villa's form is better, maybe the value is on Villa. Alternatively, considering the xG stats from [3], Villa had higher xG in their last meeting, which might indicate they're undervalued. \n\nPrediction: Based on form and xG, Villa might edge it. The prediction from [6] is 1-2 Villa. \n\nMy_say: Need to craft a engaging paragraph, maybe highlighting the European stakes, late goals in previous meetings, and key players like Watkins.\n\nCitations: Need to cite sources properly, using the numbers from the search results. For example, Villa's form from [1], BTTS stats from [5], etc.\n\nI need to make sure all facts are sourced from the provided search results and not from my own knowledge. Also, check that the lineups are as provided in the query. The user provided predicted lineups, so I should use those. Team news injuries from [8] and [14]. \n\nPutting it all together, ensuring each section has the necessary data and citations. The Asian Handicap analysis needs to carefully evaluate the odds vs the model probabilities. The betting insights should highlight markets like BTTS, over 2.5 goals, and maybe the Asian Handicap if there's value. The prediction should align with the data and analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Bournemouth (8th, 53 points) host Aston Villa (7th, 60 points) in a pivotal clash for European qualification.
