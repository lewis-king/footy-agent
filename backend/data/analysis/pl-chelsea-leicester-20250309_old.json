    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs Leicester Premier League match on March 9, 2025. Let me start by going through each of the provided search results to gather relevant information.\n\nFirst, the match overview. Search result [1] mentions that Chelsea is 5th and Leicester is near the bottom, fighting relegation. The venue is Stamford Bridge. Results [3], [4], and [5] also support Chelsea's dominance in head-to-head matches. Chelsea's recent form is mixed with some losses but they're still in the top 5. Leicester has lost six of their last seven league games, which is crucial for the analysis.\n\nNext, team news. From [2], Chelsea's injuries include Madueke, Jackson, Guiu. Lavia and Gusto are doubts. Mudryk is suspended. Fofana might return. The projected lineup in [2] and [6] shows Jorgensen in goal, Acheampong or Gusto at right-back, with Neto as striker. For Leicester, [6] mentions Pereira and Coulibaly returning but Fatawu out with ACL. Their lineup has Vardy up front.\n\nAsian handicap analysis: Search results [1], [3], and [7] suggest Chelsea -1.5 is a popular pick. Chelsea's predicted scorelines like 3-0 and 2-0 from [1] and [4] indicate a likely win by at least two goals. The handicap line given is 0, but the sources recommend -1.5, so maybe adjust the recommendation based on the actual line provided.\n\nKey player matchups: Palmer's creativity vs Leicester's midfield from [2] and [6]. Neto's pace against Faes from [6]. Nkunku vs Kristiansen could be another area, as per lineups.\n\nBetting insights: Match result leans heavily on Chelsea, as per [4] and [5] with high win probabilities. Over 3.5 goals is suggested in [7], supported by Chelsea's attacking stats and Leicester's defensive issues. Both teams to score is a no in [1], but Leicester's recent scoring drought mentioned in [6] supports that.\n\nFinal score prediction: Most sources predict 3-0 or 2-0. Confidence level around 7/10 considering Chelsea's inconsistencies but Leicester's poor form.\n\nCitations need to be mapped correctly. Each data point should link to the relevant source. For example, injuries from [2], form from [3], etc. Need to ensure all claims are backed by the sources provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea hosts Leicester City in a crucial Premier League clash with contrasting objectives.
