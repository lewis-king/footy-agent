    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Newcastle vs. Crystal Palace. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the search results provided. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market. \n\nStarting with the match overview. The search results mention Newcastle's strong form, with five consecutive wins, including a Carabao Cup victory. Crystal Palace has a decent run too, 5-1-2 in their last eight. But recent form shows Palace lost 5-2 to Man City, which might affect their confidence. I should highlight Newcastle's home advantage and their scoring streak at St. James' Park. Also, both teams have been involved in high-scoring games, so BTTS might be a good angle.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -0.75 for Newcastle at 1.84 odds. The sources indicate Newcastle's strong home form and Palace's defensive issues. The implied probability here is around 54.3% (1/1.84), but if the model suggests a higher chance, that's value. The YouTube analysis mentioned Newcastle's xG being much higher, which supports backing them on the handicap. Need to check if the recent head-to-head stats affect this. The reverse fixture was a 1-1 draw, but Newcastle's current form is better.\n\nKey player matchups: Gordon vs. Mitchell could be crucial. Gordon's pace against Mitchell's defensive skills. Also, Mateta's scoring form against Newcastle's defense. Schar and Burn need to handle Mateta, who's been scoring consistently. Eze's creativity versus Tonali and Joelinton in midfield.\n\nTeam news: The predicted lineups are provided, but I should check the search results for injuries. Source [1] mentions Palace's key players like Guehi might be doubtful. Also, Hughes is a doubt. For Newcastle, the lineup looks strong with no major injuries mentioned. Need to confirm if any players are suspended or returning.\n\nBetting insights: Over 2.5 goals seems likely based on both teams' scoring trends. Newcastle's home games have seen BTTS in five straight. Mateta's anytime scorer odds could be valuable given his form. Also, considering the correct score, maybe 3-1 to Newcastle as they've scored multiple goals at home.\n\nPrediction: Newcastle to win 3-1, confidence around 7/10. Reasoning based on home form, Palace's defensive vulnerabilities, and attacking options.\n\nMy Say: Need to craft an engaging narrative, maybe highlighting Newcastle's resurgence post-Carabao win and Palace's FA Cup semi-final distraction. Use vivid language to set the scene at St. James' Park.\n\nCitations are crucial. Each fact needs to reference the sources provided. For example, Newcastle's form from [3], Palace's recent loss from [4], Mateta's goals from [1], etc. Make sure every stat is backed by a source index.\n\nAlso, ensure the Asian Handicap analysis correctly interprets the -0.75 line. The YouTube source [7] mentions a 70% prediction for Newcastle, which aligns with the value bet if the odds imply a lower probability. Check the implied probability vs. the model's expectation.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the JSON format as specified, making sure all sections are covered with detailed analysis and proper citations. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and maintain a professional tone.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Newcastle enter this Premier League clash riding a wave of momentum with five consecutive victories across all competitions, including a statement Carabao Cup triumph that's galvanized Eddie Howe's squad[3][7].
