    "match_overview": "Manchester City hosts Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in a crucial Premier League clash with significant implications for both teams' European qualification hopes. City enter this match with mixed recent form (W2-D0-L3 in their last five league games [4]), while Brighton arrive in superior form (W4-D0-L1 in same period [4]). Historical data shows City's dominance in this fixture, winning 13 of 17 H2H meetings [6]. However, Brighton's improved away record (W3-D1-L1 last five away [4]) and City's defensive vulnerability (conceded 17 goals in last 10 games [3]) make this an intriguing tactical battle. The match features two attack-minded teams whose combined games average 3.35 goals per meeting [6], with 74% of City's home games and 73% of Brighton's away games exceeding 2.5 goals [4][6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Manchester City vs. Brighton match. First, I need to structure the JSON response as specified. Let me go through each section step by step.\n\nStarting with the match overview. The user wants a comprehensive overview including team form and recent performances. Looking at the search results, I see that Man City has a 61.3% win probability according to [1] and [5], while Brighton is at 18.8%. Recent form: Man City has 50% wins in last 10 games, Brighton 80% [3]. But wait, [4] mentions Man City's form as W2-D0-L3 last five, and Brighton W4-D0-L1. Need to reconcile these. The search results might have different time frames. Since [3] talks about last 10 games, and [4] last five, I should specify the time frames. Also, head-to-head stats from [6] show Man City dominates with 13 wins vs Brighton's 2. Etihad Stadium is a stronghold for City.\n\nNext, Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.75 for Man City with odds 1.94. From [8], the Asian Handicap is mentioned, and [3] shows Home -1.5 with 42% but that's a different line. The key here is to analyze if -0.75 offers value. Considering Man City's home form (W3-D1-L1 in last five home games [4]) vs Brighton's away form (W3-D1-L1 [4]). However, Brighton struggles against top teams away (W0-D1-L3 [4]). The handicap line seems fair, but maybe slight edge to City. The recommendation would lean towards Man City -0.75.\n\nKey player matchups. Haaland vs Brighton's defense. From the lineups, Haaland is up against Webster and van Hecke. Mitoma vs Lewis on the right. Also, Foden in midfield against Baleba and Hinshelwood. Using xG stats from [2], Brighton had 2.34 xG vs City's 2.29 in their last meeting, indicating tight contest. Haaland's presence could be crucial. Doku's pace against Lamptey might be a mismatch.\n\nTeam news: The predicted lineups are provided, but need to check injuries. From [1] and other sources, no specific injuries mentioned, so use the given lineups. Wait, the user provided lineups in the query, so I should structure injuries as per that. Since no injuries are mentioned in the search results, maybe state that both teams have key players available. But the user says to use the given lineups, so structured section should reflect that.\n\nBetting insights. Over 2.5 goals is strong here. [3] and [4] both highlight high scoring games. [4] mentions 68% of City's and Brighton's games go over 2.5. Also, Both Teams to Score YES at 56% [3]. Correct score 4-1 to City has 10% [3], but maybe 2-1 is more likely [1]. For Asian Handicap, Home -0.75 at 1.94 is a value bet given City's home edge.\n\nPrediction: 2-1 to Man City with medium confidence. Reasoning based on simulation models [1][5], H2H dominance [6], and Brighton's away record vs top teams [4].\n\nMy Say needs to be engaging. Highlight the clash of City's title ambitions vs Brighton's surprise form. Mention key players and tactical battles. Use vivid language to set the scene at Etihad.\n\nCitations: Need to map each fact to the search results. For example, win probabilities from [1][5], H2H from [6], form stats from [3][4], xG from [2], odds from [8].\n\nNeed to ensure all data is correctly cited and structured in JSON without markdown. Also, check that all recommendations are backed by sources, and odds are accurately represented in decimal format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Manchester City hosts Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in a crucial Premier League clash with significant implications for both teams' European qualification hopes.
