    "match_overview": "Chelsea host Leicester City at Stamford Bridge in a Premier League clash with significant implications for both teams. Chelsea (5th) aim to reclaim a top-four spot, having won two consecutive games across competitions. Leicester (19th) sit six points from safety, winless in 11 of their last 12 league matches. Historically, Chelsea dominate this fixture with 63 wins in 126 meetings and four victories in their last five Premier League encounters[4]. The Foxes have scored just once in their last four league games[7], while Chelsea's attack has produced 11 goals in their last five home matches[3].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs Leicester Premier League match. The key points they mentioned are the date, venue, home and away team forms, and the Asian handicap line and odds. They also specified including match overview, team news, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, betting insights, and a score prediction.\n\nFirst, I need to review all the provided search results to gather relevant data. The search results include articles from various sources like The Football Faithful, Sportskeeda, Dimers, and others. These should provide team news, predicted lineups, injury updates, and analysis.\n\nStarting with the match overview: Chelsea is fifth in the league and looking to get back into the top four. Leicester is 19th and struggling. The head-to-head records from source [4] show Chelsea has a strong historical record against Leicester. Recent form from sources [1], [2], [7] indicates Chelsea's inconsistency but recent wins, while Leicester has been poor with multiple losses.\n\nTeam news: For Chelsea, source [1] mentions Filip Jorgensen returning in goal, Malo Gusto fit, and Romeo Lavia back in training but may not start. Noni Madueke, Marc Guiu, and Nicolas Jackson are out. Source [14] adds that Wesley Fofana and Benoit Badiashile are back in training, Trevoh Chalobah available, but Nicolas Jackson and Madueke still out. Leicester's injuries from sources [10], [12], [13] include Abdul Fatawu (ACL), Ricardo Pereira (long-term), and Wilfred Ndidi may have returned from a hamstring injury. Stephy Mavididi might start.\n\nProjected lineups: Chelsea's lineup from [1] is Jorgensen; Gusto, Tosin, Colwill, Cucurella; Caicedo, Fernandez; Neto, Palmer, Sancho; Nkunku. Source [14] suggests Fofana might start. Leicester's predicted XI from [11] and [13]: Hermansen; Kristiansen, Vestergaard, Faes, Justin; Soumare, Ndidi; Mavididi, El Khannouss, Buonanotte; Vardy.\n\nAsian handicap analysis: The line is 0, so Chelsea needs to win by any margin. Sources [3], [5], [6] predict Chelsea to win comfortably. Chelsea's home form is decent, Leicester's away form is poor. Stats from [2], [4] show Chelsea's dominance in H2H. Value might be on Chelsea -2 as per [8], but the user's line is 0, so recommending Chelsea to cover the handicap.\n\nKey player matchups: Cole Palmer vs Wilfred Ndidi from [2], [11]. Ndidi's role in midfield against Palmer's creativity. Christopher Nkunku vs Wout Faes based on [9], [14]. Nkunku's attacking threat vs Faes' defensive struggles.\n\nBetting insights: Match result - Chelsea to win (odds around 1.2). Over/under - Over 2.5 goals likely as Chelsea's attack is strong and Leicester's defense weak ([2], [3], [6]). Both teams to score - No, since Leicester hasn't scored in their last four games ([6], [7]).\n\nFinal score prediction: Chelsea 3-0 Leicester, confidence level 7/10. This aligns with sources [3], [7], [8], [9], considering Leicester's poor scoring form and defensive issues.\n\nCitations need to be mapped correctly. For example, team news for Chelsea's injuries comes from [1], [14], Leicester's injuries from [10], [12], [13]. Head-to-head stats from [4], form analysis from [2], [5], [6].\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea host Leicester City at Stamford Bridge in a Premier League clash with significant implications for both teams.
