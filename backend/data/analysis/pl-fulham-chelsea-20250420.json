    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Fulham vs. Chelsea Premier League match on April 20, 2025. Let me start by going through all the search results provided to gather the necessary information.\n\nFirst, looking at the match overview. The Sportytrader source [1] mentions that Fulham has a 42.51% chance of winning, Chelsea 43.27%, and a draw at 14.22%. That's pretty close, indicating a tight game. Chelsea is just one point off a Champions League spot, so motivation is high. Fulham is pushing for European qualification too, but they just lost to Bournemouth [3]. Chelsea's recent form is mixed; they drew with Ipswich and Brentford but beat Tottenham [3]. Fulham has strong home form, beating Liverpool and Tottenham recently [3].\n\nNext, team news. The predicted lineups are given in the query, but I need to check the sources for injuries and suspensions. Source [3] says Harry Wilson is out for Fulham. For Chelsea, Mykhailo Mudryk is suspended, and Romeo Lavia and Wesley Fofana are injured. I should structure this into the team_news section with citations.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, source [2] suggests Fulham at 0.0 with +106 odds (which is 2.06 in decimal). The user provided Asian Handicap Home Odds as 2.08, which is close. The analysis from [2] argues Fulham has value here because of their home form. Comparing the implied probability (1/2.08 = 48.08%) with Sportytrader's 42.51% for a Fulham win and 14.22% draw, if we consider the Asian Handicap 0.0 as a draw no bet, the effective probability for Fulham not losing would be their win probability plus half the draw probability. But maybe the model from [2] thinks Fulham's chance is higher than the bookies' odds suggest. Also, Chelsea's away form is poor, with no wins in the last eight away league games [3], which supports Fulham's value here.\n\nKey player matchups. Rodrigo Muniz for Fulham has scored in two straight home games [2], up against Chelsea's defense that's been inconsistent. Pedro Neto for Chelsea has had over 1.5 shots in recent games [2]. Cole Palmer is crucial in midfield. I should highlight these matchups with data from the sources.\n\nBetting insights. Under 2.5 goals is supported by multiple sources [1][3], with five of the last seven H2H games having under 2.5. Fulham's Asian Handicap 0.0 at 2.08 odds is a value bet [2]. Both teams to score is another angle, as H2H games often see goals from both sides [3]. Rodrigo Muniz to score anytime at +210 [2] could be good value given his form.\n\nPrediction. Considering Chelsea's away struggles and Fulham's home strength, a 1-1 draw seems plausible, but maybe a narrow Fulham win. However, the prediction needs to align with the data. Source [3] predicts Both Teams to Score, but [1] and [2] lean towards under 2.5 and Fulham's handicap. The user's model might favor a close game, so a 1-0 Fulham win as per [2]'s correct score suggestion, but also considering Chelsea's need for points.\n\nMy_say should be engaging, highlighting the clash between Fulham's home fortress and Chelsea's European ambitions, maybe touch on the tactical battle and key players like Muniz and Palmer.\n\nNeed to ensure all facts are cited correctly from the provided sources, using the right indices. Also, check the odds are accurately represented and the Asian Handicap analysis is clear. Make sure the JSON structure is exactly as specified, with all required fields filled out, including citations and raw data sections.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Fulham hosts Chelsea in a crucial Premier League clash with European implications for both sides.
