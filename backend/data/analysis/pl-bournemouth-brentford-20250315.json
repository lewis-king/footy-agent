Bournemouth's season has been defined by explosive attacking play (1.71 xG/match) [1] but recent defensive lapses have seen them win just once in five matches [4][6]. Brentford arrive with momentum from four consecutive away wins [4], though their underlying numbers reveal defensive vulnerabilities (1.92 xGA/match) [8]. Historically, Brentford dominate this fixture with seven wins in the last ten meetings [10], including a 3-2 reverse fixture victory [6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Bournemouth vs Brentford match. Let's start by breaking down the query to make sure I cover all parts. The user wants a structured JSON output with specific sections: match_overview, asian_handicap_analysis, key_player_matchups, team_news, betting_insights, prediction, and my_say. Plus, citations need to be handled properly with references from the provided search results.\n\nFirst, looking at the match_overview. I need to give a comprehensive overview, including team form and recent performances. From the search results, I see Bournemouth has 12 wins, 8 draws, 8 losses [1][7], and Brentford has 11 wins, 5 draws, 12 losses [8]. Bournemouth's recent form is a bit shaky with 1 win in the last 5 [4][6], while Brentford has 4 wins in their last 10 but just lost to Aston Villa [6][9]. Head-to-head, Brentford has dominated with 7 wins in the last 10 [10], and they have a good away record recently [4][9]. Also, Bournemouth's xG is 1.71 vs Brentford's 1.37 [1][8], but their xGA is 1.52 compared to Brentford's 1.92, which might indicate defensive strengths.\n\nNext, the asian_handicap_analysis. The line is -0.75 for Bournemouth. Their home form is decent with 1.81 xG at home [1], but the recent dip in form [4][6] might affect this. Brentford's away xG is lower at 1.14 [8], but they've scored 12 goals in last four away games [4]. The recommendation here would be to consider Bournemouth's inconsistency but higher xG, maybe leaning towards Bournemouth covering the handicap, but considering the H2H, maybe Brentford could be a value bet. Wait, the Asian Handicap odds are 2.03 for Home and 1.95 for Away. So, the analysis needs to weigh these factors. The table should compare form, home/away stats, H2H, and value. Value might be on Brentford given their away record and Bournemouth's recent struggles, but the data from search results might suggest otherwise.\n\nKey_player_matchups: Justin Kluivert vs Bryan Mbeumo. Kluivert has 12 goals [4], and Mbeumo is key for Brentford. Also, Evanilson vs Brentford's defense. Bournemouth's Zabarnyi is suspended [6][11], so that affects their defense. Brentford's defense has a higher xGA, so maybe Bournemouth's attackers can exploit that. Need to cite sources where these stats come from.\n\nTeam_news: Bournemouth's injuries include Zabarnyi suspended [6][11], others from the predicted lineup. Brentford's lineup as per the predicted but need to check if there are any injuries mentioned. Search results mention Bournemouth missing Zabarnyi [6][11], and possibly others. The structured team news should reflect injuries and suspensions from the sources.\n\nBetting_insights: Markets like Match Result, Over/Under, Both Teams to Score, and Player Prop (Kluivert). Bournemouth's BTTS is 60% in last 10 [3], Brentford's is 30% [3], but recent form shows Brentford scoring in away games [4]. Over 2.5 goals is likely as Bournemouth has 60% Over in last 10 [3], Brentford 40% [3]. Odds from search results: Over 2.5 is -205 [4], so maybe recommend Over 2.5. Kluivert scoring again as he did in the previous H2H [4][11].\n\nPrediction: Score prediction based on form and data. Bournemouth 2-1 Brentford seems common in the sources [12], but some predict a draw [9][13]. Considering Bournemouth's home advantage but defensive issues without Zabarnyi, maybe 2-1 Bournemouth. Confidence level around 7 since their form is inconsistent.\n\nMy_say: Needs to be engaging, highlight the European chase, key players, and the tactical aspects. Mention the late goals Bournemouth scores [14], Brentford's away form, and the importance of this match for both teams.\n\nCitations: Every fact needs a source. For example, Bournemouth's xG is from [1], Brentford's from [8]. H2H stats from [10]. Injuries from [6][11]. Make sure each claim is backed by a source index.\n\nNow, putting all this together in the JSON structure, ensuring all fields are filled with data from the search results and properly cited. Need to check that each section uses the correct data and citations, avoiding any personal knowledge. Also, format the Asian Handicap table correctly with headers and rows based on the data. Make sure the team_news uses the lineups provided and reflects the suspensions and injuries mentioned in the search results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League clash pits ninth-placed Bournemouth (44 points) against 12th-placed Brentford (38 points) in a vital match for European qualification hopes.
