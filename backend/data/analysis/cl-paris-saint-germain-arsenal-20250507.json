    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the PSG vs. Arsenal Champions League semi-final second leg. First, I need to review all the provided search results to gather up-to-date information. \n\nStarting with the match overview: PSG won the first leg 1-0 at Arsenal. The second leg is at Parc des Princes. PSG's recent form includes a 2-1 loss to Strasbourg, but they rotated players since they've already secured Ligue 1. Arsenal lost to Bournemouth recently, which might affect their morale. Head-to-head stats show Arsenal has a slight edge, but PSG has been strong at home against English teams.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -0.25 for PSG at 1.85 odds. I need to compare this with statistical models. The Opta supercomputer initially favored Arsenal but after the first leg, PSG's chances might have improved. The xG from the first leg shows Arsenal had higher xG but didn't score, which could indicate they're due for regression. PSG's home form is strong, so the handicap might offer value.\n\nKey player matchups: Dembele vs. Arsenal's right-back, maybe White. Dembele scored in the first leg and his fitness is a concern. Donnarumma's saves were crucial, so his performance against Arsenal's attackers like Saka and Martinelli will be key. Also, Rice vs. PSG's midfield (Neves, Vitinha) could control the game tempo.\n\nTeam news: PSG's lineup includes Donnarumma, Hakimi, Marquinhos, etc. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's hamstring issue is a question mark. Arsenal's lineup has Raya, Saliba, Rice, Saka. They have no major injuries reported but need to score.\n\nBetting insights: Looking at BTTS, PSG's home games often see goals. The odds for BTTS yes are 1.6, which might be good value. Over 2.5 goals is another angle, considering both teams' attacking tendencies. Correct score prediction of 2-1 PSG aligns with their home advantage and Arsenal's need to attack.\n\nPrediction: PSG might win 2-1, but the Asian Handicap -0.25 at 1.85 is a value bet given their home strength. My confidence is 7/10 because Arsenal could push hard but PSG's defense and counter might prevail.\n\nIn \"My Say,\" I should highlight the stakes, the tactical battle, and key players. Maybe mention the historical context of both teams seeking their first UCL title, adding drama.\n\nNeed to ensure all data points are cited correctly from the sources. Check for any conflicting info, like Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's injury status from source [4] and [9]. Also, verify the xG stats from [3] and [11]. Make sure the odds mentioned match the provided Asian Handicap line and decimal formats.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Paris Saint-Germain host Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg holding a 1-0 aggregate advantage after Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's early strike at the Emirates.
