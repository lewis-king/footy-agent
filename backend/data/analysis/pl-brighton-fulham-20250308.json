    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by tackling the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Brighton vs Fulham Premier League match on March 8, 2025. The user specified several sections to include: match overview, team news, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, betting insights, and a final score prediction. Plus, it needs to be in a specific JSON format. \n\nFirst, I'll check the provided search results to gather relevant data. The search results have info on head-to-head stats, team news, predictions, odds, and form. Let's parse through each one.\n\nFrom [1], the H2H shows Fulham has a better record with 9 wins out of 18. Recent matches, as per [3], show Fulham won the last two encounters 3-1 and 3-0. That's significant for the H2H section. Brighton's home advantage might balance this, though.\n\nLooking at team news in [5], Brighton has several injuries: Lamptey (suspended), Dunk, Veltman, etc. Their projected lineup is a 4-2-3-1 with Verbruggen in goal. Fulham's missing Lukic (suspended) and others, with Pereira filling in. Their lineup is also 4-2-3-1. Need to structure this into injuries, suspensions, returnees, and lineups for both teams.\n\nFor the Asian handicap analysis, [6] suggests Fulham +0.5 at -112. The user provided a handicap line of 0, so the analysis should consider that. Fulham's recent away form (LDWDW) vs Brighton's home form (WDLWL). Also, Brighton's injuries might weaken their defense, making Fulham a good pick. The table in [2] shows Albion's trends, including 4-1 in last 5 games, but that might be outdated given the current form.\n\nKey player matchups: From [5], Brighton's Joao Pedro as the playmaker against Fulham's Andreas Pereira. Also, Mitoma vs Castagne on the wings. These are crucial battles. The midfield duel between Baleba and Berge could dictate the game's tempo.\n\nBetting insights: Match result odds from [8] have Brighton at 42.8% win probability. Over/under stats: [6] mentions under 2.5 at +110, but [8] suggests under 2.5 with 51% chance. However, recent H2H games have seen over 2.5 goals, so maybe over is a better value. Also, BTTS is likely given both teams' scoring records.\n\nFinal score prediction: [4] predicts 2-1 Brighton, but [7] and [8] suggest a draw possibility. Considering injuries and form, maybe a 1-1 draw with Fulham covering the handicap. Confidence level around 7/10 as it's a tight match.\n\nNeed to structure all this into the JSON format. Ensure all 'raw' fields have detailed analysis. Check if all data-driven points are covered, like H2H, form, injuries, and market values. Also, cite sources where applicable but in the JSON structure without markdown. Make sure all keys match the schema and there's no markdown in the JSON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League encounter between Brighton & Hove Albion and Fulham at the Amex Stadium presents a clash of mid-table aspirants with contrasting recent trajectories.
