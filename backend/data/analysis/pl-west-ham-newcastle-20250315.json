    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by gathering all the necessary information from the search results provided. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Everton vs West Ham Premier League match on March 15, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the team news. From sources [1], [2], [6], and [7], Everton have several injuries. Key players like Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Dwight McNeil, Iliman Ndiaye, and Orel Mangala are out. Armando Broja is back in training but unlikely to play against West Ham. Beto is their main striker. For West Ham, sources [6] mention Michail Antonio and Crysencio Summerville are out, while Niclas Fullkrug and Vladimir Coufal are doubtful. So, both teams have significant absentees.\n\nNext, recent form. Everton's form is DDDWD (unbeaten in 8 league games) according to the user's input and sources [1], [3], [6]. West Ham's form is LWWLL, as per the user's input and source [3]. Everton seems to be in better form but with a lot of draws. West Ham is inconsistent but has some wins.\n\nLooking at head-to-head stats from [3], [14], the last 5 meetings include 2 Everton wins, 2 West Ham wins, and 1 draw. The most recent was a 0-0 draw. So, it's quite balanced historically.\n\nFor predictions and odds, source [3] gives Everton a 41.9% chance, West Ham 30.1%, and draw 28.0%. Source [4] mentions Everton's odds at +105 (approx 2.05 decimal) to win. Source [9] has Everton at 48.8% implied probability, but the model suggests 55-60%, indicating value. The Asian Handicap in [4] is Everton -0.5 at +108 (2.08), West Ham +0.5 at -122 (1.82). \n\nExpected goals (xG) data from [12] shows Everton with 2.85 xG vs West Ham's 1.97 in their last meeting. Recent xG stats from [9] and [12] suggest Everton creates more chances but also concedes. West Ham's xG is lower but they might be more efficient.\n\nKey player matchups: Beto vs West Ham's defense, especially if Fullkrug is out. James Garner's form in midfield against Tomas Soucek. Jarrad Branthwaite vs Mohammed Kudus on the wing.\n\nBetting insights: Everton to win at 2.05 (source [4]), Under 2.5 goals based on both teams' recent trends (source [10]), and Both Teams to Score at 1.95 (source [4] mentions Yes at -105 which is ~1.95). \n\nPrediction: Everton 1-0 West Ham, given their home form and West Ham's struggles away. Moyes' motivation against his old club adds to Everton's edge.\n\nIn 'my_say', I should highlight Moyes facing his former team, Everton's defensive resilience, and the potential impact of returning players post-international break. Make it engaging with a narrative around Moyes' return and both teams' mid-table battle.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Everton host West Ham in a mid-table Premier League clash with both teams sitting on 33 points.
