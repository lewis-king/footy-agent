    "match_overview": "Chelsea host Everton at Stamford Bridge in a crucial Premier League clash, with the Blues chasing Champions League qualification (57 pts, 5th) and Everton comfortably mid-table (38 pts, 13th)[3][5]. Chelsea boast formidable home form (16 wins in 24 home matches) and have lost just 2 of their last 23 league games at Stamford Bridge[3][5]. Everton arrive with minimal relegation concerns but have won only 1 of their last 8 league matches[5]. Recent simulations give Chelsea a 61.7% win probability versus Everton's 16.9%[1], while xG data shows Chelsea's attacking superiority (1.73 xG vs Everton's 0.82)[2]. The Blues have kept 3 clean sheets in their last 4 home games, facing an Everton side that's scored just twice in 5 matches[5][8].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Chelsea vs Everton. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market.\n\nStarting with the match overview. Chelsea is 5th with 57 points, Everton 13th with 38. Chelsea's home form is strong, 16 wins in 24 home matches. Everton has 3 wins in last 6 away. Head-to-head, Chelsea has a good record against Everton, especially at home. Recent simulations from Dimers.com give Chelsea a 61.7% win probability, which aligns with Forebet's 2-0 prediction. xG stats from xgscore.io show Chelsea's xG at 1.73 vs Everton's 0.82. That's a significant difference. Also, Chelsea's defensive stats: 8 clean sheets, 1.21 goals conceded per game. Everton's attack isn't great, only 2 goals in last 5 matches. So Chelsea's defense looks solid here.\n\nNext, team news. From Sports Mole and London World, Chelsea has injuries: Fofana, Gusto, Kellyman out; Guiu doubtful. Everton has Mangala and Calvert-Lewin out. The predicted lineups are given, so I need to check if any key players are missing. For Chelsea, Gusto's absence might affect the right flank, but Reece James is starting. Everton missing Calvert-Lewin means Beto is up front, who's less proven. That's a big deal for their attack.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis. The line is -1.0 for Chelsea at 2.5 odds. The user emphasized understanding Asian Handicap. Chelsea needs to win by two goals for the bet to win. From the simulations, Chelsea's win probability is around 62%, but the implied probability for -1.0 AH is 40% (1/2.5). That's a value opportunity because the model suggests a higher chance. Also, Chelsea's xG superiority and Everton's low away scoring support this. The recommendation here would be Chelsea -1.0 AH as a value bet.\n\nKey player matchups. Cole Palmer vs Everton's midfield. Palmer's creativity and xG contribution (from footystats.org, Chelsea's xG is 1.82 per match) against Everton's defensive midfielders like Gueye and Garner. Also, Beto vs Chelsea's center-backs. Beto's aerial ability might be a threat, but Chelsea's defense has been solid. Another matchup could be Reece James against Mykolenko. James' attacking runs could exploit Everton's left side.\n\nBetting insights. \n1. Chelsea to win at 1.57 odds (from search result 1). The model's 62% win probability implies odds of 1.61, so 1.57 offers slight value.\n2. Under 2.5 goals. Everton's low scoring and Chelsea's recent unders (4 of last 6 H2H). Odds around 1.85 (from search 9) with a 68% probability (search 15) makes this a good bet.\n3. Chelsea clean sheet. 3 clean sheets in last 4 home games. Everton's attack struggling, so odds around 2.0 (inferred from search 5) could be valuable.\n\nPrediction should be Chelsea 2-0 Everton, aligning with Forebet and Dimers' simulations. Confidence level around 7/10 because of Chelsea's form but possible Everton resilience.\n\nMy Say needs to be engaging. Highlight Chelsea's push for Champions League, Everton's safety, key absences, and tactical aspects. Mention the xG disparity and how Chelsea's midfield control could dictate the game. Maybe add a quirky stat about Chelsea's home record against Everton.\n\nCitations are crucial. Each fact needs to reference the search results. For example, Chelsea's win probability from [1], xG stats from [2], injuries from [4][8], H2H from [3], etc. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered and multiple sources are cited where applicable.\n\nNeed to ensure all data is sourced from the provided results, not prior knowledge. Check each stat against the search results. Also, avoid lists and use paragraphs as per the report format. Convert any list-based info into flowing text.\n\nFinally, structure the JSON correctly, ensuring all sections are filled with the required details, citations, and proper odds formatting. Double-check the Asian Handicap analysis table for accuracy, using the headers and rows as specified. Make sure the team news uses the predicted lineups provided and cites the injury sources correctly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea host Everton at Stamford Bridge in a crucial Premier League clash, with the Blues chasing Champions League qualification (57 pts, 5th) and Everton comfortably mid-table (38 pts, 13th)[3][5].
