    "match_overview": "This Premier League clash between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford features a stark contrast in form. Arsenal (2nd, 54 pts) remain title outsiders but face a Manchester United side (14th, 33 pts) battling defensive crises and mid-table mediocrity. United's 6-1-7 home record contrasts with Arsenal's 7-5-2 road form, while H2H stats favor United (33W-25L) despite Arsenal's 3-1 league win earlier this season[6][8]. The Gunners enter as -143 favorites with United at +450, reflecting their 16-point gap over relegation-threatened hosts[1][5].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis query for the Man Utd vs Arsenal match. First, I need to parse all the given search results to gather the necessary information. The user wants a detailed JSON response with specific sections like match overview, team news, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, betting insights, and a prediction. \n\nStarting with the match overview. From the search results, I see that Arsenal is in better form, sitting second in the league, while Man Utd is 14th. Recent encounters mention a 1-1 FA Cup draw and Arsenal's previous league win. The latest odds from sources like CBS Sports and SportsGambler show Arsenal as favorites (-145 to -143), which aligns with their stronger position.\n\nNext, team news. Search results [2], [9], [11], and [12] provide injury details. For Man Utd, key absences include Lisandro Martinez, Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire (doubtful), and Patrick Dorgu (suspended). Arsenal's injuries are significant too: Havertz, Jesus, Martinelli, Saka, and Tomiyasu out. Projected lineups from sources like 90min and Squawka suggest possible lineups for both teams. Man Utd might have a makeshift defense, while Arsenal could field players like Raya, Saliba, Odegaard, and Trossard.\n\nAsian handicap analysis. The user specified a 0 line with both teams at 1.90. Search results [3], [8], and others recommend Arsenal with a handicap. For instance, Eastbridge suggested Arsenal -0.25 at 2.05, and Givemesport recommended -1.0. However, given the current line is 0, I need to adjust. Arsenal's strong away form (7-5-2) and Man Utd's defensive issues make Arsenal the better pick here. The analysis should mention their road performance and United's injuries affecting their defense.\n\nKey player matchups. Bruno Fernandes vs Thomas Partey comes up, as Fernandes is United's main creator, and Partey's role in stopping him is crucial. Another matchup is Garnacho vs Timber, where Timber's defensive skills against Garnacho's pace could be decisive. These are supported by sources [13] and [12].\n\nBetting insights. The match result leans towards Arsenal, with odds around -143. Over/Under 2.5 goals is tricky. Sources [3] and [6] note that half of United's home games and Arsenal's road games hit over 2.5, but recent trends have more unders. However, with Arsenal's attacking strength and United's defensive woes, over 2.5 might have value. Both Teams to Score could be a good option given United's scoring at home and Arsenal's attacking form.\n\nPrediction. The simulations from [14] suggest 0-1 to Arsenal. Considering United's injuries and Arsenal's form, a 1-2 scoreline with confidence 7/10 seems reasonable. The reasoning should mention Arsenal's ability to exploit defensive gaps.\n\nCitations are crucial here. Each data point needs to reference the appropriate search result. For example, team injuries for Man Utd come from [2][11], while Arsenal's lineup from [9][13]. The Asian handicap analysis cites [3][8]. Ensuring each fact is backed by a source index.\n\nNeed to structure the JSON exactly as specified, ensuring all fields are populated. The 'raw' fields should contain additional details from the sources. For citations, list all used sources with URLs in the <think> section, making sure each source is correctly numbered and linked.\n\nFinally, the 'my_say' section needs a journalist-style conclusion, highlighting the clash's excitement and key factors, tying together the analysis points. Sources like [6] and [8] discuss the historical rivalry and current dynamics, which can be woven into the narrative.\n\nOverall, the key challenge is synthesizing all the information from 14 sources into a coherent, data-driven analysis while adhering strictly to the JSON format and citation rules. Ensuring that each part of the response is supported by the provided search results and that the recommendations are justified with statistical and situational evidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League clash between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford features a stark contrast in form.
