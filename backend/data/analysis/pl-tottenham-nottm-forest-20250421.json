    "match_overview": "This mid-table clash pits 16th-placed Tottenham against 6th-placed Nottingham Forest in a match with contrasting motivations. Tottenham's disastrous domestic campaign (7 home losses) contrasts with Forest's surprise Champions League push, though Nuno's side arrives on a 2-game losing skid[12][6]. Recent form shows Spurs' 4-2 loss at Wolves[2] versus Forest's 1-0 defeat to Everton[6]. Historically, Tottenham dominate H2H (5 wins in last 7)[3], but Forest won December's reverse fixture 1-0[8]. With Spurs prioritizing Europa League progression[6] and Forest needing points for top 4, tactical approaches will clash - Spurs' high-risk build-up (70% pass accuracy) vs Forest's direct style (77% accuracy)[1].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by tackling this betting analysis for Tottenham vs Nottingham Forest. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results and structure it according to the JSON format specified.\n\nStarting with the match overview. The user mentioned that Tottenham is 16th in the league, while Forest is 6th. From the search results, I see that Tottenham has been inconsistent, especially at home, with 7 losses. Forest, on the other hand, is pushing for Champions League qualification but has lost their last two games. Recent form: Tottenham lost 4-2 to Wolves, and Forest lost 1-0 to Everton. Head-to-head, Tottenham has dominated historically but lost the last meeting 1-0. These points should be included.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is +0.0 with home odds 1.98 and away 1.92. Looking at the sources, some suggest Forest has value here. For example, source [1] mentions Forest as underdogs but with potential, and [7] gives Forest a 33.4% win probability. The Asian Handicap table needs to compare form, home/away stats, H2H, and value. Using stats from [3], Tottenham's home form is weak, while Forest's away form is decent. The recommendation would lean towards Forest +0.0 based on their motivation and Tottenham's poor home record.\n\nKey player matchups. Chris Wood (Forest) has 18 goals, and his return from injury (source [5]) is crucial. For Tottenham, Solanke is the main threat. Midfield battle between Bissouma and Anderson could be key. Source [6] mentions Udogie's tackles, but he's not in the predicted lineup, so maybe focus on other players. Also, Maddison's creativity vs Yates' defensive work (source [15]) could be a point.\n\nTeam news. From the predicted lineups, Tottenham has Vicario in goal, Solanke up front. Injuries: Source [4] mentions Son and Maddison were doubtful previously, but the predicted lineup includes Maddison, so maybe he's fit. Forest's Wood is back from injury (source [5]). Need to structure injuries, suspensions, returnees for both teams. The user provided lineups, so injuries should reflect that. Maybe Tottenham has Dragusin injured (source [12]), and Forest has Awoniyi doubtful (source [12]).\n\nBetting insights. Look for value in markets. BTTS is supported by both teams' defensive issues (source [1], [6]). Over 2.5 goals is another angle, as both teams have high-scoring games. Forest to score first (source [11]) and cards market (source [15]) with Yates and Dominguez likely to be booked. Odds from sources: BTTS Yes is around 1.8, Over 2.5 at 1.9. Need to check the exact odds from the search results but some sources mention specific odds.\n\nPrediction. Model from [7] suggests 1-1 draw, but Forest's motivation might edge them. A 1-2 win for Forest with medium confidence. Reasoning based on their away form and Tottenham's focus on Europa League.\n\nMy Say. Need a journalist-style conclusion. Highlight the contrast between the teams, Forest's rise, Tottenham's struggles. Mention key players and the stakes for Champions League. Make it engaging with some flair.\n\nCitations are crucial. Each fact needs to be backed by the correct source index. For example, Forest's xG stats from [10], Tottenham's home goals from [13], H2H from [3], etc. Make sure to cite after each relevant sentence.\n\nAlso, check if all data is from the provided sources and not prior knowledge. For example, Chris Wood's 18 goals are from [5], Tottenham's defensive issues from [1], etc.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the JSON format, ensuring all sections are covered with detailed analysis and proper citations. Double-check the Asian Handicap explanation to avoid mistakes, as per the user's note.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This mid-table clash pits 16th-placed Tottenham against 6th-placed Nottingham Forest in a match with contrasting motivations.
