    "match_overview": "Crystal Palace host Bournemouth at Selhurst Park in a crucial Premier League clash with European qualification implications. Palace arrive reeling from consecutive 5-2 and 5-0 defeats against Manchester City and Newcastle, exposing defensive vulnerabilities despite their attacking threat (9 BTTS in last 10 home games)[1][6]. Bournemouth snapped a 5-game winless streak with a 1-0 victory over Fulham, maintaining their status as away goalscorers extraordinaire (2+ goals in 10/11 away matches)[1][6]. Historically, Bournemouth hold a slight edge with 3 wins in the last 5 H2Hs[6], though Palace's home advantage could prove pivotal in this evenly-matched contest[7][8].",

Watch for the chess match between Iraola's high-press system and Glasner's counter-attacking blueprint - a tactical duel where every midfield turnover could spark lightning transitions.

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this Crystal Palace vs Bournemouth betting analysis. First, I need to gather all the relevant info from the provided search results. The match is on April 19, 2025, at Selhurst Park.\n\nStarting with the match overview. Crystal Palace had a rough week, losing 5-2 to Man City and 5-0 to Newcastle. Their defense is leaking goals, but they've been strong at home with BTTS in 9 of their last 10 home games. Bournemouth just beat Fulham 1-0, ending a poor run. They score a lot away, with 2+ goals in 10 of 11 away matches. H2H is mixed, but recent games favor Bournemouth. Both teams are mid-table but pushing for Europe, so motivation is there. That sets the context.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is +0.0, with Palace at 1.94 and Bournemouth at 2.02. From the sources, Palace's recent form is shaky, especially defensively. Bournemouth's away form is strong offensively. The expected goals (xG) data from the Ipswich match shows Bournemouth had a high xG but lost, indicating maybe bad luck. Palace's xG against Brighton was lower. The handicap seems balanced, but Bournemouth's attacking form might give them an edge here. So maybe Bournemouth +0.0 is a value bet.\n\nKey player matchups. Mateta vs Evanilson. Mateta is Palace's main scorer, but Evanilson has been in form for Bournemouth. Eze vs Adams in midfield. Eze's creativity against Adams' defensive skills. Mitchell vs Semenyo on the wings. Semenyo's pace could exploit Palace's defensive issues.\n\nTeam news needs to be checked. From the sources, Palace has Guehi suspended (source [5]), Doucoure out, but Kamada returning. Bournemouth missing Christie, Kluivert, Sinisterra, Unal. Their lineup has Evanilson up front. Use the predicted lineups given, but adjust for injuries. Cite the sources where injuries are mentioned.\n\nBetting insights. BTTS is likely given both teams' trends. Bournemouth Over 1.5 Team Goals based on their away scoring. Maybe Palace Double Chance given home advantage but defensive issues. Use the odds from the search results. For example, BTTS Yes is at 1.61 (source [2]), which seems good value given both teams' stats.\n\nPrediction. Bournemouth might edge it 2-1. Their attacking form away and Palace's defensive woes. Confidence 7/10.\n\nMy Say needs to be engaging. Highlight the clash of Palace's home resilience vs Bournemouth's attack. Maybe mention the 10 goals conceded by Palace in two games as a storyline. Use vivid language to set the scene.\n\nCitations: Make sure each fact is backed by the correct source index. For example, Palace's BTTS home record is from [1], Bournemouth's away goals from [1], injuries from [5] and [6]. xG stats from [3] and [4]. Odds from [2] and [6].\n\nCheck all guidelines: Use decimal odds, avoid American terms. Ensure Asian Handicap line is correct. Focus on data-driven points, not general observations. Provide actionable bets with value based on implied probabilities vs model predictions.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the required JSON format, making sure each section is filled with detailed analysis and proper citations. Double-check that all sources are correctly cited and the info is up-to-date as per the sources provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Crystal Palace host Bournemouth at Selhurst Park in a crucial Premier League clash with European qualification implications.
