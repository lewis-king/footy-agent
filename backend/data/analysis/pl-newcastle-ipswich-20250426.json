Newcastle arrive with four wins in their last five league games, including dominant 5-0 and 4-1 victories over Crystal Palace and Manchester United respectively [1][2]. Ipswich have lost four of their last five, conceding 13 goals in this span [2][5]. The Magpies won December's reverse fixture 4-0 at Portman Road, extending their H2H dominance to five wins in seven meetings [1][7]. St. James' Park has been a fortress with five wins in Newcastle's last six home games, while Ipswich have managed just one away win since January [1][2][6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Newcastle vs Ipswich Premier League match on April 26, 2025. Let me start by going through the search results and relevant data provided.\n\nFirst, the match overview. Newcastle is 5th in the league, aiming for Champions League spots, while Ipswich is 18th and likely to be relegated. The head-to-head stats show Newcastle's dominance, especially the 4-0 away win in December. Recent form: Newcastle has 4 wins in their last 5, while Ipswich has 1 win. St. James' Park is a strong home advantage for Newcastle with 5 wins in last 6 home games. Ipswich's away form is poor, only 1 win in 6. Need to cite sources [1][2][5][6].\n\nNext, Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -2.0 with home odds 1.93. Newcastle's recent big wins (5-0 vs Crystal Palace, 4-1 vs Man Utd) and Ipswich's defensive issues (conceding 13 in 5 games) suggest they can cover -2.0. xG stats from [3] show Newcastle's higher expected goals. Also, Newcastle's average goals scored at home and Ipswich's average conceded away support this. Value is there because bookmaker odds imply ~51.8% probability, but Newcastle's form suggests higher chance. Sources [1][2][5][6][7].\n\nKey player matchups: Isak vs Ipswich's defense. Isak has been in form, and Ipswich's O'Shea and Greaves have struggled. Also, Bruno Guimaraes vs Morsy in midfield. Newcastle's midfield dominance could control the game. Barnes and Murphy on the wings against Ipswich's full-backs, who have weak defensive stats. Cite [4][5][7].\n\nTeam news: Newcastle's lineup is strong with Pope, Schar, Isak. Ipswich has Davis suspended (red card vs Arsenal) which weakens their defense. Injuries? From the search results, Newcastle has no major injuries mentioned. Ipswich's lineup includes Palmer in goal, who has a low save percentage. Need to check sources [4][6][7].\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Newcastle -2.0 Asian Handicap at 1.93. \n2. Over 3.5 goals at 2.10 (Newcastle's high scoring and Ipswich's defensive record). \n3. Isak to score anytime at 1.65. \n4. Newcastle to win both halves at 2.20. \n5. Correct score 4-0 at 12.00. These are supported by recent goal stats and H2H [1][2][5][6][7].\n\nPrediction: 4-0 Newcastle. Confidence due to home form, Ipswich's struggles, and previous H2H. \n\nMy Say: Need a compelling narrative about Newcastle's Champions League push and Ipswich's relegation battle. Highlight the contrast in form and stakes. Use vivid language to engage readers, maybe reference the previous 4-0 win and potential repeat. Cite sources [1][2][5].\n\nCitations: Make sure all facts are backed by the provided sources, using their indexes. Check each stat against the sources to ensure accuracy. For example, Newcastle's 5 wins in last 6 home games from [1], Ipswich's away form from [2], xG from [3], lineup from [4], etc.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the required JSON format, ensuring all sections are covered with detailed analysis and proper citations. Avoid lists, use paragraphs where needed, and maintain the formal tone with data-driven insights.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Newcastle United host Ipswich Town in a Premier League clash where the Magpies (5th, 59pts) aim to solidify their Champions League push, while Ipswich (18th, 21pts) face near-certain relegation.
