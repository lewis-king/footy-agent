    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Tottenham vs. Nottingham Forest match, focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market. The user provided specific lineup predictions and some search results. \n\nFirst, I need to structure the analysis according to the JSON schema they provided. The key sections are match_overview, asian_handicap_analysis, key_player_matchups, team_news, betting_insights, prediction, and my_say. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's info on team form, injuries, previous encounters, and statistical data like xG. For example, search result [1] mentions Spurs' defensive injuries and Forest's defensive vulnerabilities. Result [2] highlights Forest's strong record against lower-half teams and their rest advantage. Result [6] suggests Forest might avoid defeat. \n\nIn team_news, the user provided predicted lineups, but I should check the search results for any injuries or suspensions. Result [8] mentions Spurs' injuries like Vicario, Romero, van de Ven, and Richarlison. Forest's lineup seems mostly intact except for Ibrahim Sangare. \n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is +0.0 with Spurs at 1.85 and Forest at 2.09. The user emphasized correct interpretation here. From the data, Spurs are 15th, Forest 4th. Forest's away form is good (8 wins, 2 draws, 6 losses). Spurs have lost 4 of last 6. This might indicate value on Forest +0.0. \n\nKey player matchups: Solanke vs. Milenkovic/Murillo. Spurs' defense is weakened, so Chris Wood could exploit that. Maddison vs. Yates/Anderson in midfield. \n\nBetting insights: Both Teams to Score, Forest +0.0 Asian Handicap, and Over 2.5 Goals. xG stats from [3] and [12] show both teams have decent xG, supporting BTTS and Over. \n\nPrediction: Considering form and injuries, Forest might edge it 2-1. \n\nMy_say needs to be engaging, highlighting the clash of Spurs' struggles vs. Forest's European push. Mention key players and tactical points. \n\nCitations are crucial. Each fact needs to reference the search results. For example, injuries from [8], form from [2], xG from [3][12], etc. \n\nI need to ensure all data points are sourced correctly and the JSON structure is followed exactly. Also, avoid lists and use the specified formatting. Check that odds are in decimal and terminology is European. \n\nFinally, verify that the analysis is data-driven, uses the provided sources, and adheres to the user's guidelines. Make sure the Asian Handicap analysis is accurate, considering the line and team strengths.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Tottenham host Nottingham Forest in a Premier League clash with contrasting motivations - Spurs languishing in 15th while Forest push for European qualification[2][5].
