    "match_overview": "Saturday's Premier League clash pits bottom-placed Southampton against a Wolves side seeking to secure top-flight survival. The Saints come into this match on an eight-game home losing streak, having conceded 29 goals during this collapse [6][9]. Wolves arrive six points clear of relegation after taking seven points from their last five matches, though their away form remains suspect with just two wins in 14 road trips [3][6]. Historically, Wolves dominate this fixture with six consecutive H2H victories while keeping four clean sheets [9][13]. Southampton's defensive frailties persist, conceding 3+ goals in eight of their last nine league matches [9], while their xGA of 2.1 per home game ranks worst in the division [11].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Southampton vs Wolves Premier League match on March 15, 2025. They provided specific instructions and search results, so I need to make sure I use those sources accurately. \n\nFirst, I need to structure the JSON according to their schema. Let me start with the match overview. From the search results, Southampton is in terrible form, with only 2 wins all season and a lot of defensive issues. Wolves are inconsistent but in a better position, six points clear of relegation. I need to mention their recent forms and head-to-head records. The sources [3][6][9][13] all highlight Southampton's struggles and Wolves' slight edge.\n\nNext, the team news section. The user provided predicted lineups, but I need to check the injuries from the search results. For Southampton, Tyler Dibling is out with an ankle injury (source [1][7]). Ryan Fraser, Ross Stewart, Juan Larios, and James Bree are also out (sources [4][9]). Jan Bednarek is doubtful. For Wolves, Matheus Cunha is suspended, and players like Yerson Mosquera, Enso Gonz\u00e1lez, Sasa Kalajdzic are out (sources [3][9]). Marshall Munetsi is doubtful. I need to structure this into the injuries, suspensions, returnees, and projected XI for both teams, citing the sources correctly.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is +0.25 for Southampton. Wolves are slight favorites. I need to compare form, home/away stats, and H2H. Southampton's home form is awful (8 losses in a row), and Wolves have a strong H2H record (6 straight wins). The table should show the key stats, citing sources [3][6][9][13]. The recommendation would back Wolves at -0.25, considering their edge and Southampton's defensive woes.\n\nKey player matchups: Maybe Walker-Peters vs Ait-Nouri, since Walker-Peters is back from injury (source [4]) and Ait-Nouri's role in Wolves' attack. Also, Archer against Wolves' defense, which has been inconsistent. Sources [9][13] mention Archer's role and Wolves' defensive issues despite clean sheets.\n\nBetting insights: Look at Wolves to win (2.15 odds), under 2.5 goals (source [13] tips under), and Wolves clean sheet (Southampton's poor scoring record). Also, maybe a correct score prediction of 0-2. Need to ensure odds are in decimal format and cite sources where stats come from.\n\nPrediction: Wolves to win 2-0 with confidence around 7/10. Reasoning based on form, H2H, and injuries.\n\nMy_say: Need a journalist-style wrap-up, highlighting the stakes for both teams, Southampton's dire situation, Wolves' chance to secure safety. Mention key absences and how they might impact the game. Make it engaging and story-driven, citing sources [3][13] for context.\n\nCitations are crucial here. Every claim must have a source index. I need to make sure all data points are backed by the provided search results and cited properly. Let me check each section again to ensure accuracy and proper citation. Also, avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON structure. Ensure that the 'citations' array lists all sources used with their URLs and descriptions as per the guidelines.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Saturday's Premier League clash pits bottom-placed Southampton against a Wolves side seeking to secure top-flight survival.
