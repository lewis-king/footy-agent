    "match_overview": "Real Madrid face a monumental task as they trail 3-0 from the first leg, needing a historic comeback at the Bernab\u00e9u. Arsenal's defensive masterclass in London (2.0 xG vs 0.3 xG) exposed Madrid's defensive vulnerabilities, with the Spanish giants conceding 1.21 xG per game this season - their worst defensive campaign since 2018-19[5][11][14]. While Madrid have won 5 of their last 10 matches, they've kept just 2 clean sheets in that span. Arsenal arrive with Europe's third-best defensive record (0.88 xGA per game) and a 7-match unbeaten Champions League run[7][14]. The Gunners' counter-attacking threat (Martinelli: 4.3 progressive carries/90) clashes with Madrid's firepower (Vinicius: 3.7 dribbles completed/90)[14].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Real Madrid vs. Arsenal Champions League match. Let me start by gathering all the necessary information from the search results provided.\n\nFirst, the match overview. Real Madrid lost the first leg 3-0 to Arsenal, so they need a big comeback. Arsenal is in a strong position but has to defend that lead. From the search results, I see that Arsenal's defense is solid, with the best defensive record in the Premier League and second in the Champions League [7][8]. Real Madrid's recent form is mixed; they've won 5 of their last 10 but conceded a lot [6][12]. Their defense is shaky, allowing 1.21 xG per game recently [14]. Arsenal's xG in the first leg was 2.0 vs. Madrid's 0.3 [5][11], showing their dominance.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.75 for Madrid at 2.05 odds. I need to compare this with the teams' forms. Madrid's home form is strong, but their defense is a concern. Arsenal's away form is decent, and they have a solid defense. The handicap might be too high considering Arsenal's defensive stats. Maybe the value is on Arsenal +0.75 at 1.88 [6][7][12]. Also, the over/under for the first half could be a good bet since Madrid will attack early, and Arsenal can counter [1][2].\n\nKey player matchups: Vinicius Jr. vs. Arsenal's right-back Timber. Vinicius is key for Madrid, but Timber has been solid defensively. Rice vs. Bellingham in midfield. Rice's defensive skills could neutralize Bellingham's creativity. Saka against Fran Garcia; Saka's pace might exploit Garcia's defensive weaknesses [9][14].\n\nTeam news: The predicted lineups are given. Madrid has Tchouameni back, which strengthens their midfield. Arsenal is missing Zinchenko and Tomiyasu, so Lewis-Skelly and Kiwior are in defense. No major injuries reported beyond that [4][9].\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Arsenal +0.75 Asian Handicap at 1.88 seems valuable given their defensive record and Madrid's need to overcommit.\n2. First Half Over 1.5 Goals at 2.21 (from search results, Madrid will push early, Arsenal can counter [1][2]).\n3. Both Teams to Score at 1.72 (Madrid's attack vs. Arsenal's defense, but Arsenal can score on counters [8][14]).\n4. Saka Anytime Goalscorer at 3.50 (he's in good form and can exploit Madrid's left flank [9][14]).\n\nPrediction: Madrid might win 2-1, but Arsenal advances on aggregate. The handicap value is on Arsenal. Confidence level 7/10 because Madrid's defense is vulnerable.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the clash of styles, Madrid's need for goals vs. Arsenal's solid defense. Mention the historical context and key players. Make it engaging and build excitement around the match's narrative.\n\nI need to structure all this into the JSON format, ensuring all citations are correctly referenced with the source indexes. Also, check that all facts are from the provided search results and not prior knowledge. Make sure the odds are accurately represented in decimal format and the Asian Handicap analysis aligns with the given line.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Real Madrid face a monumental task as they trail 3-0 from the first leg, needing a historic comeback at the Bernab\u00e9u.
