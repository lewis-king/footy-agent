    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Tottenham vs Bournemouth Premier League match on March 9, 2025, following the specified JSON format. Let's start by reviewing all the provided search results to gather necessary data.\n\nFirst, the match overview. From source [1], Tottenham is coming off a Europa League loss, which might affect their morale. Bournemouth has been performing better this season. The head-to-head record from [4] shows Tottenham has dominated with 12 wins out of 17, but Bournemouth won the last encounter 1-0. Recent form from the query says Home form WDWLW and Away LDWDW. Need to mention both teams' recent forms and European commitments affecting Tottenham.\n\nTeam news: Source [2] and [6] mention injuries. Tottenham's injuries include Richarlison, Dragusin, Kulusevski. Solanke might be fit per [7]. Bournemouth's injuries from [6] include Senesi, Smith, Unal, Zabarnyi suspended. Projected lineups from [2], [6], and [7] have some variations. Need to consolidate these. For Tottenham, Vicario in goal; Porro and Spence as full-backs; Gray and Danso at CB due to Romero/Van de Ven being rested. Midfield Bentancur, Sarr, Bissouma. Attack: Johnson, Son, Tel or Odobert. Bournemouth's lineup from [6] has Kepa, Hill, Cook, Huijsen, Kerkez; Adams, Scott; Semenyo, Brooks, Kluivert; Evanilson.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: Source [3] recommends Bournemouth 0.0 at -122. They mention a 60% probability. But Tottenham's home form is shaky (7 losses at home this season per [7]), but Bournemouth's away form is strong. Need to compare form, H2H, and stats. From [4], Tottenham's average goals at home is 2.00, Bournemouth's away is 1.69. Both have high BTTS and Over 2.5 stats. Corners: Both teams have high corner counts as per [1] and [3], so over 11.5 corners could be a bet.\n\nKey player matchups: Tottenham's Son vs Bournemouth's Cook/Huijsen. Bournemouth's Evanilson vs Tottenham's Gray/Danso. Midfield battle between Bentancur and Adams/Scott.\n\nBetting insights: Match result could be a draw as per [5] (2-2 prediction). Over 2.5 goals is likely given both teams' scoring stats. Both teams to score yes. Asian handicap Bournemouth 0.0. Corners over 11.5.\n\nFinal score prediction: Considering recent form and injuries, maybe a 2-2 draw. Confidence level 7/10 as both teams are inconsistent but offensively capable.\n\nCitations: Need to track which sources support each point. For example, injuries from [2][6][7], H2H from [4], Asian handicap from [3], etc. Ensure each citation is properly numbered in the JSON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Tottenham hosts Bournemouth in a crucial Premier League clash with European implications.
