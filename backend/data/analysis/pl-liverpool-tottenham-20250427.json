    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Liverpool vs Tottenham Premier League match on April 27, 2025. Let's start by going through each section required and the information I have from the search results and the given lineups.\n\nFirst, the match overview. Liverpool are top of the league, 13 points clear, and could clinch the title with a win. Tottenham are mid-table, struggling with form and injuries. Recent meetings: Liverpool won 6-3 in December 2024 and have a strong H2H record. From search results, Liverpool's xG in that December game was 5.63, showing their dominance. Tottenham's injury issues are significant, with 9 players out mentioned in source [4]. \n\nNext, Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -1.75 for Liverpool at 1.85 odds. Need to compare this with model predictions. Source [6] and [14] mention Liverpool's win probability around 74%, which translates to odds around 1.35. The bookmaker's 1.85 offers value. Also, Liverpool's home form is strong, and Tottenham's away form is poor (source [10] shows Spurs lost 4 of last 5 away). The handicap seems justified given the xG dominance and current form.\n\nKey player matchups. Salah vs Djed Spence (source [3] mentions Spence's struggles against Salah in previous games). Szoboszlai vs Bentancur: Szoboszlai had 2 assists in the 6-3 win (source [3]). Van Dijk vs Solanke: Solanke is Spurs' main threat, but Van Dijk's stats are solid (source [15] shows Liverpool's defensive xG in previous match was low).\n\nTeam news: Use the given lineups. Injuries for Tottenham from source [4] include Romero, van de Ven, Maddison, Sarr, etc. Liverpool's only major absence is Alexander-Arnold, but he's back in training (source [9]). \n\nBetting insights: \n1. Liverpool -1.75 AH at 1.85 (value based on probability discrepancy).\n2. Over 3.5 goals: Past meetings have high goals (source [3], [11]).\n3. Salah to score: He's in form, scored twice in the 6-3 win (source [3], [11]).\n\nPrediction: Liverpool 3-1. Their attacking strength and Spurs' defensive issues. Confidence level 8/10.\n\nMy say: Highlight the title implications, Liverpool's dominance, Spurs' injury woes, and key players like Salah. Make it engaging with stats and narrative from sources [3], [8], [11].\n\nNeed to ensure all facts are sourced correctly. Check citations for each claim. For example, Liverpool's xG in December game from [8], injuries from [4], form from [10], etc. Also, use decimal odds as specified. Avoid American terms. Make sure the JSON structure is exact, with proper citations in the analysis sections.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Liverpool enter this clash as Premier League leaders needing a win to secure their 20th title, boasting a 13-point gap over Arsenal with four games remaining[11][13].
