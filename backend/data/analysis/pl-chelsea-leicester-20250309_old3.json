Chelsea have won 5 of their last 6 H2H meetings, while Leicester arrive winless in 5 league games and scoreless in their last 4. Stamford Bridge has been a fortress for Chelsea, who boast 18 consecutive home matches with 1+ goals scored [5][9]. Leicester's porous defense (2.26 goals conceded/game) and toothless attack (0 goals in 400+ minutes) make them vulnerable [4][6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs Leicester Premier League match. Let me start by reviewing the search results provided. \n\nFirst, looking at the match overview. Chelsea's recent form is mixed but they've won their last two games, including a Conference League match against Copenhagen. Leicester is in poor form, sitting 19th with four consecutive losses without scoring. Head-to-head records show Chelsea's dominance, winning 5 of the last 6 meetings. The prediction here would lean heavily on Chelsea's superior form and Leicester's struggles.\n\nNow, team news. For Chelsea, sources mention injuries to Madueke, Jackson, Guiu, and Mudryk is suspended. Gusto was a doubt but seems likely to start. Fofana and Lavia might return. Projected lineups from different sources vary slightly, but Gusto, Chalobah, Colwill, Cucurella in defense; Caicedo, Enzo in midfield; Palmer, Sancho, Nkunku; Neto up front. Leicester has injuries to Stolarczyk, Daka, Choudhury. Their lineup is weaker, especially in defense.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is Chelsea -2 at -105. Chelsea's attacking stats are strong, averaging almost 2 goals per game. Leicester's defense is poor, conceding 2.26 per game. Chelsea's home form and Leicester's away struggles (69% loss rate) make covering the -2 handicap feasible. The value here is on Chelsea given the probability vs odds discrepancy.\n\nKey player matchups: Palmer vs Leicester's midfield. He's crucial in creating chances. Also, Sancho and Nkunku on the wings against Leicester's full-backs could exploit their defensive weaknesses. Another matchup is Neto against Leicester's center-backs, who have been error-prone.\n\nBetting insights: Match result heavily favors Chelsea. Over 2.5 goals is likely given both teams' trends. Both Teams to Score 'No' makes sense as Leicester hasn't scored in four games. Correct score prediction of 3-0 Chelsea based on recent H2H and Leicester's defensive issues.\n\nFinal score prediction: 3-0 to Chelsea with high confidence because of the factors mentioned. They're motivated for top four, Leicester's morale is low, and Chelsea's squad depth even with some injuries.\n\nCiting sources appropriately. Use the search results [1], [5], [8], [12], etc., to back each claim. Need to ensure the JSON structure is followed exactly, including all required fields like match overview, team news structured, Asian handicap table, key matchups, betting insights, and prediction.
