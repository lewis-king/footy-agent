    "match_overview": "This pivotal Premier League clash sees 4th-placed Newcastle (63pts) host 5th-placed Chelsea (63pts) in a direct battle for Champions League qualification. Newcastle boast the league's 3rd-best home record (11W-2D-4L), averaging 2.24 goals per game at St James' Park[1]. Chelsea's away form (7W-4D-6L) reveals vulnerability, with just 1 clean sheet in their last 9 road trips[3]. The Magpies have won their last 5 home league games by an aggregate 18-3 scoreline, including a 5-0 demolition of Crystal Palace[9]. Chelsea arrive fresh from a 3-1 win over Liverpool but have only earned 6 points from their last 7 away matches[19]. Historically, Newcastle have won 7 of their last 11 home PL matches against Chelsea[4].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Newcastle vs. Chelsea. First, I need to gather all the relevant data from the provided search results. Let's start by looking at each team's recent form.\n\nNewcastle is 5th in the Premier League with 19 wins, 6 draws, and 10 losses. Their home form is strong: 11 wins, 2 draws, 4 losses. They've scored 66 goals overall, with 38 at home. Alexander Isak is their top scorer with 21 goals. Recent form shows 4 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss in the last six, including a 5-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace. However, they have some injury concerns: Joelinton out, Trippier and Schar possibly doubtful.\n\nChelsea is 4th, same points as Newcastle but better goal difference. They have 18 wins, 9 draws, 8 losses. Away form is 7 wins, 4 draws, 6 losses. Cole Palmer leads with 15 goals. Recent form includes a 3-1 win over Liverpool but inconsistent away results. Injuries: Fofana and Kellyman out, Lavia and Guiu might return.\n\nHead-to-head: Newcastle has won the last three home games against Chelsea, including a 2-0 win in the Carabao Cup this season. Chelsea's historical edge but recent struggles at St. James' Park.\n\nAsian Handicap line is -0.25 for Newcastle at 1.93. Implied probability is about 51.8%. Opta's model gives Newcastle a 44.7% chance, which suggests value on Chelsea's +0.25 at 2.00 (50% implied vs. 30.8% actual). But Newcastle's home strength and Chelsea's away issues might tilt it.\n\nKey player matchups: Isak vs. Chelsea's defense. Isak has 19 goals since December. Chelsea's defense has been solid but might struggle. Also, Palmer vs. Newcastle's midfield. Newcastle's high press could disrupt Chelsea's build-up.\n\nBetting insights: Newcastle's home Over 2.5 goals at 1.80 (66% historical, 65% in H2H). Isak to score anytime at 2.10 (21 goals this season). Asian Handicap Chelsea +0.25 at 2.00 as value given Opta's model discrepancy.\n\nPrediction: Newcastle 2-1 Chelsea. Their home form and Chelsea's defensive absences give them the edge.\n\nMy Say: This clash is crucial for UCL spots. Newcastle's fortress vs. Chelsea's resilience. Isak's form and Chelsea's midfield battle. Expect fireworks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This pivotal Premier League clash sees 4th-placed Newcastle (63pts) host 5th-placed Chelsea (63pts) in a direct battle for Champions League qualification.
