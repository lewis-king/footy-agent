While Spurs sit 13th with nothing but pride to play for, Bournemouth (7th) remain in the hunt for Champions League qualification (8.8% chance per Opta)[2]. Tottenham's 41.2% win probability (Dimers)[1] clashes with Bournemouth's 36.1% chance, creating a tight market. Historically, Spurs dominate H2H at home (6 wins/7 matches)[12], but lost December's reverse fixture 1-0 despite Bournemouth's xG supremacy (3.32 vs 0.83)[7]. Both teams enter on poor form - Spurs with 2 straight losses[3], Bournemouth with 2 PL defeats[6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by looking at the query. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Tottenham vs Bournemouth Premier League match. They specified using data-driven insights, especially xG and Asian Handicap analysis. First, I need to structure the JSON as per their schema and ensure all sections are covered.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide win probabilities. Dimers [1] and Opta [2] suggest Tottenham's win probability is around 41-44%, while Bournemouth is 33-36%. The draw is about 22-24%. These probabilities should inform the prediction section.\n\nTeam news is crucial. From source [3], Tottenham has injuries to Kulusevski, Solanke (doubtful), Richarlison, and Dragusin. Bournemouth misses Zabarnyi due to suspension and has doubts over Christie and Araujo. This affects the projected lineups and team news section.\n\nFor Asian Handicap analysis, source [4] mentions the handicap line, but the latest from [10] shows Bournemouth at -122 for 0.0 AH. The form comparison from [12] indicates Tottenham's home struggles but historical dominance over Bournemouth. The xG stats from [7] in their previous meeting show Bournemouth had higher xG, which might indicate they can create chances again.\n\nKey player matchups: Justin Kluivert from Bournemouth has been in form [11], while Son Heung-Min is Tottenham's main threat. Their duel could be pivotal. Also, the full-back battle, maybe Udogie vs Tavernier, as Bournemouth's wing play is strong.\n\nBetting insights: Both Teams to Score (Yes) is supported by high-scoring history between these teams [12]. Over 2.5 Goals is likely given both teams' defensive issues. Bournemouth on Draw No Bet offers value considering their recent form and Tottenham's injuries.\n\nPrediction should align with the data. Though Tottenham is at home, their injuries and recent Europa League commitment might affect performance. A 2-1 Bournemouth win seems plausible with a confidence level around 6/10.\n\nIn 'my_say', highlight the contrast between Tottenham's European struggles and Bournemouth's push for Europe. Emphasize key players and tactical battles to engage readers.\n\nNow, compile all this into the JSON structure, ensuring citations are correctly referenced with the provided sources. Double-check odds from [10] and injury info from [3][8]. Make sure each section is detailed in 'raw' fields as per instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Tottenham host Bournemouth in a crucial Premier League clash with European implications.
