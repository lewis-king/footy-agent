    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start breaking down this query. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Brighton vs Aston Villa Premier League match on April 2, 2025, focusing on value opportunities. They provided several search results, so I need to extract the most relevant data from those.\n\nFirst, the match overview. I see Brighton is seventh with 47 points and Aston Villa is ninth with 44 points. The gap is three points, which makes this game crucial for European spots. From source [5], the recent form: Brighton has a 50% win rate in the last four, Villa has six consecutive wins. But source [3] says Brighton has 60% wins in last 10, Villa 70%. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, looking closer, source [3] says Brighton won 6 of last 10, Villa 7 of last 10. But source [5] mentions Villa's six-game win streak. Maybe that's more recent. Need to check dates. The sources are from April 1 and 2, 2025. So recent form matters. Source [5] says Villa has a perfect six-game streak, which is significant.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the given line is -0.25. From source [3], the algorithm suggested Home -1.25 with 40%, but that's conflicting. Wait, the user provided the Asian Handicap line as -0.25, so the analysis should center around that. Source [8] mentions Aston Villa's Asian Handicap home win rate at 70%, Brighton's at 50%. But this is an away game for Villa. The current line is Brighton -0.25, so they're slight favorites. The odds are 2.0 on both sides, implying a close match. Source [3] shows Brighton's Over 2.5 goals in 80% of last 10 games, Villa 70%. So the total goals market might be relevant.\n\nKey player matchups: Looking at the lineups, Mitoma vs Cash for Brighton's left side. Watkins is Villa's main striker. From source [4], Brighton has injuries to Webster and Georginio. Their absence might affect defense and midfield. Source [5] mentions Jo\u00e3o Pedro and Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n as crucial for Brighton. For Villa, Rashford and Asensio are highlighted. But the predicted lineup here has Rogers and McGinn. Need to check the provided lineups. The user gave the predicted lineups, so I should reference those. Mitoma vs Cash, Welbeck vs Mings and Konsa. Also, the goalkeeper battle: Verbruggen vs Martinez.\n\nTeam news: From source [4], Brighton's Webster and Georginio are out with hamstring and ankle injuries. That's confirmed in the structured team news. The predicted lineups are provided, so I need to list those as given. Source [5] mentions Mitoma's update, but the user's lineup includes Mitoma, so maybe he's fit.\n\nBetting insights: Looking for value. The Asian Handicap line at -0.25 with 2.0 odds. Source [5] suggests Brighton as slight favorites. The Over/Under 2.5 goals: source [3] shows both teams have high Over 2.5 rates. The BTTS market: source [3] says Brighton 50% Yes, Villa 60%. So BTTS Yes might have value. Also, corners: source [7] shows Brighton averages more corners. The user's example mentioned corners Over 9.5. From source [5], the recommendation was Over 9.5 corners. With Stuart Attwell as referee (source [7]), who has a high card rate, maybe cards markets.\n\nPrediction: Considering recent form, Villa's six-game streak, but Brighton's home advantage. The prediction in source [5] was a Brighton win, but the H2H stats in source [7] might show Villa dominance. Need to check H2H. Source [7] shows Brighton has a 64% BTTS rate, which is above league average. The xG stats from source [2] in December 2024: Villa had 1.77 xG vs Brighton's 1.10. But that's an older match. The xG predictability was 78%. The predicted score from xG was 1.78-1.23, so a close game. Maybe a 2-1 Villa win? Or a draw? Wait, source [5] had a predicted score of 1.78-1.23, but the actual recommendation was Brighton to win. But considering Villa's form, maybe a draw or Villa edge.\n\nMy Say: Need to create a engaging narrative. Mention the stakes for European spots, key players returning from injury, tactical battles. Highlight the contrasting styles: Brighton's possession vs Villa's counter-attacks.\n\nCitations: Need to cite sources properly. For example, injuries from [4], form stats from [3] and [5], xG from [2], referee stats from [7], etc. Each fact must have a citation.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. Ensure all sections are covered with data from the sources, cited correctly. Check for value opportunities based on odds vs statistical probabilities. For example, if the model suggests a higher probability than the odds imply, that's a value bet.\n\nIn Asian Handicap analysis, considering Brighton's home form and Villa's away form. Source [6] shows Albion (Brighton) are 4-1 in last 5 games, which is strong. The Asian Handicap line -0.25 at 2.0 odds. If the model suggests Brighton has a 55% chance, the implied probability for 2.0 is 50%, so value exists. But need to check the actual stats. Source [3] says Brighton's last 10 games: 6 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses. Villa's 7 wins, 2 draws, 1 loss. But home/away splits? Source [5] says Brighton's home advantage. The Asian Handicap recommendation might lean towards Villa +0.25 if their form is better, but the line is -0.25 Brighton. Hmm, conflicting data. Need to reconcile this.\n\nAlso, considering injuries, Brighton's missing players might weaken them. So maybe Villa has an edge. But the line is Brighton -0.25, so the analysis should assess if that's justified. If Villa's form is better, maybe the value is on Villa +0.25. But the user provided the line as -0.25 Brighton, so the analysis needs to evaluate that.\n\nIn the betting insights, look for markets where the odds don't match the stats. For example, BTTS Yes has 1.85 odds in source [5], and both teams have high BTTS rates. That could be a value bet. Over 2.5 goals is another, with both teams' high Over rates. Corners Over 9.5 from source [5] at 1.73 odds might be good too.\n\nThe prediction should balance all factors. Maybe a 2-2 draw, given both teams' attacking form and defensive issues. Or a narrow Villa win. But the xG from the previous match (source [2]) favored Villa, but that was months ago. Recent form from source [5] says Villa is on a six-game streak. So maybe Villa +0.25 is the value bet.\n\nFinally, ensure all claims are backed by sources, and the JSON structure is correct with citations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This crucial Premier League clash sees 7th-place Brighton (12-11-6) host 9th-place Aston Villa (12-9-8) at the Amex Stadium, with just three points separating these European hopefuls.
