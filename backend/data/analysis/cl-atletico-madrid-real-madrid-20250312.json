    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Champions League match between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. Let me start by going through the provided search results and extract the necessary information.\n\nFirst, the match overview. The second leg is at Atletico's home, Metropolitano Stadium. Real won the first leg 2-1, so they have an advantage. Atletico's form is a bit shaky with two recent losses, but their home record is strong. Real's form is better, with only one loss in ten games. Head-to-head at this venue shows Atletico has won three of the last six meetings. Both teams have key players with minor injuries but are expected to play. \n\nFor team news, Real's Vinicius, Bellingham, and Rodrygo have minor injuries but should be available. Atletico might have De Paul as a concern. Oblak is their main goalkeeper. Projected lineups from search results: Atletico likely with a 3-5-2, Real in a 4-3-1-2 with Bellingham returning.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line isn't specified, but looking at the odds from search result [12], the initial Asian Handicap was Real -0.5 in the first leg. Now, since Real leads, the handicap might be different. But the user mentioned no Asian Handicap line provided, so maybe focus on the analysis based on form and stats. Atletico's home xG is 1.74, Real's away xG is lower. Defensively, Atletico is solid at home. Real's away form is good, but they've struggled here historically. The value might be on Atletico with a handicap, considering their home advantage and need to attack.\n\nKey player matchups: Vinicius vs Atletico's right flank, maybe Llorente. Bellingham against Koke. Griezmann against Real's defense. Using xG stats from [3], Atletico's higher home xG could be a factor.\n\nBetting insights: Both teams to score is likely, as seen in past meetings. Over 2.5 goals is supported by Real's UCL games. Atletico to score first half given their fast starts. Maybe a correct score prediction of 2-1 Atletico, but aggregate might go to extra time.\n\nPrediction: Considering the first leg result, Real might play defensively. Atletico needs to score, so a 2-1 win for them, but Real advances on aggregate. Confidence around 6/10 because it's a derby and unpredictable.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the intensity of the derby, the tactical battle between Simeone and Ancelotti, and key players like Bellingham and Griezmann. Emphasize the Champions League stakes and historical context.\n\nCitations need to be properly referenced. Sources mention injuries [2], xG stats [3], past meetings [1], and betting odds [4][5][9][13]. Each point should cite the relevant sources. Need to structure all into the required JSON format, ensuring correct odds in decimal format and following all guidelines.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"The Champions League Round of 16 second leg sees Atl\u00e9tico Madrid host Real Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, trailing 2-1 on aggregate.
