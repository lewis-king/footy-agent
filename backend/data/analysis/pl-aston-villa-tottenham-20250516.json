    "match_overview": "Aston Villa host Tottenham in a crucial Premier League clash with European implications. Villa sit 6th with 56 points, boasting a strong home record (10W-4D-4L) and 1.67 xG/90 at Villa Park[1][2]. Tottenham languish in 17th, having lost 4 of their last 5 league matches while conceding 2.23 xGA/90 in away games[7][18]. Recent H2H favors Villa (3W-1D-1L last 5), including a 4-1 loss at Spurs earlier this season where Villa still generated 1.98 xG[4][15]. With Spurs prioritizing next week's Europa League final, Villa's superior organization (1.27 xGA/home vs Spurs' 1.57 xGA/away) and clinical finishing (Ollie Watkins: 16 PL goals) present a compelling advantage[1][4][18].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Aston Villa vs. Tottenham Premier League match on May 16, 2025. Let me start by reviewing the user's query and the provided search results to gather all necessary information.\n\nFirst, the user wants a data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market. They emphasized using sourced information, not base knowledge, so I must rely on the search results provided.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of data. Aston Villa's xG stats from [1] and [2] show they have an xG of 1.45 overall, 1.67 at home. Tottenham's xG from [18] is 1.61 overall but 1.47 away. Defensively, Villa's xGA is 1.43, while Tottenham's is 1.51. This suggests Villa might have a slight edge, especially at home.\n\nRecent form from [7] mentions Villa had a five-match winless streak but are now in good form, while Tottenham is struggling with five league losses. The head-to-head from [11] and [15] shows Villa has 3 wins in the last 5, Spurs 1. That's a positive sign for Villa.\n\nInjuries are crucial. From [12] and [13], Villa is missing Rashford, Kamara, Torres, Bailey, and Disasi. Tottenham has a lot of injuries too: Romero, Maddison, Kulusevski, Van de Ven, etc. This could affect both teams' lineups and performance.\n\nThe Asian Handicap line is -1.5 for Villa with odds 1.89. According to [6], the model gives Villa a 62.9% chance to win. Converting that to decimal odds, 1/0.629 \u2248 1.59. The bookmaker's 1.89 is higher, indicating value. But I need to check if the -1.5 line is justified. Villa's recent home form is strong, and Spurs' defensive issues (conceding 2+ goals in four straight away games [16]) might make the -1.5 line achievable.\n\nKey player matchups: Watkins vs. Tottenham's defense. Watkins has 16 league goals [4], and Spurs' defense is weakened. Also, Villa's midfield with Kamara and Onana could dominate Spurs' depleted midfield.\n\nFor betting insights, Villa's team total over 2.5 goals at +100 [17] seems good given Spurs' defensive stats. Both teams to score is likely because Villa's defense isn't rock solid, and Spurs have attacking threats like Son and Richarlison.\n\nPrediction should align with the data: Villa win, maybe 3-1. Confidence level around 7/10 considering Spurs' focus on the Europa League final.\n\nIn \"my_say,\" I need to craft an engaging narrative. Highlight Villa's resurgence under Emery, Spurs' struggles, and the significance of the match for European qualification. Maybe mention the historical context from [4] about Villa's 150th season and Champions League participation.\n\nI need to ensure all facts are sourced correctly. For example, Villa's xG stats from [1][2], Tottenham's from [18], injuries from [12][13], form from [7][16], and H2H from [11][15]. Also, correctly cite each source in the analysis.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the required JSON format, making sure to include citations properly and follow all guidelines. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and ensure the analysis flows naturally with data-driven insights.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Aston Villa host Tottenham in a crucial Premier League clash with European implications.
