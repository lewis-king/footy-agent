    "match_overview": "Everton host Manchester City at Goodison Park in a crucial Premier League clash with contrasting motivations. Everton (13th, 8W-14D-10L) have shown improved defensive resilience under David Moyes, keeping 5 clean sheets in their last 10 home games[1][2]. However, their attacking output remains concerning - ranking 3rd worst for goals scored (34) and failing to score in 41% of matches[1]. Manchester City arrive sitting 4th with Champions League ambitions, but their 1.82 goals/game average represents a 22% decline from last season[3][7]. Pep Guardiola's side has won 12 of their last 14 Premier League meetings with Everton[7], though their recent away form shows vulnerability with 3 losses in 5 road trips[3][7].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Everton vs. Man City. First, I need to gather all the relevant data from the provided search results. Let's start with the match overview.\n\nEverton's form from search result [1] shows they're 13th in the league with 8 wins, 14 draws, and 10 losses. Their home form isn't great\u20144 wins, 8 draws, 4 losses. They average 1.06 goals scored and 1.19 conceded per match. Their xG is 1.27, which is lower than their actual goals, indicating maybe some inefficiency. Manchester City's recent form from [3] mentions they're in the top four but had a tough February, losing to Real Madrid in UCL and some league games. However, they beat Newcastle and Tottenham. The FA Cup is their hope for silverware.\n\nLooking at head-to-head, [7] says City hasn't lost to Everton in 14 Premier League meetings, with 12 wins and 2 draws. That's a dominant record. Sean Dyche was sacked in January, and David Moyes took over, according to [2]. Everton's recent form under Moyes might be more defensive, which could influence their approach.\n\nInjuries and lineups: The predicted lineups are given, but I need to check if there are any injuries. From [2], Everton's main scorer is Iliman Ndiaye with 7 league goals. City's lineup includes De Bruyne up front, which is interesting. No major injuries mentioned in the search results except for the managerial change.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is +0.5 for Everton at 1.98. From [4], City is favored with a 49% win chance, Everton 25%. The handicap here means if Everton gets a draw or win, the bet wins. But given City's dominance, maybe City -0.5 at 1.96 is better. However, Everton's home form isn't terrible, with 4 wins and 8 draws. But City's recent form includes wins against top teams. The value might be on City, but [4] suggests City -1 Asian Handicap. Wait, the current line is +0.5, so maybe the recommendation is different. Need to check the stats again.\n\nKey player matchups: Ndiaye vs. City's defense. He's Everton's top scorer. City's defense has Ruben Dias and Gvardiol. Also, De Bruyne playing as a false nine could disrupt Everton's center-backs. Garner and Gueye in midfield need to contain City's midfield trio.\n\nBetting insights: Under 2.5 goals might be good. Everton's matches average 2.25 goals overall, but at home it's 2.56. However, City's recent games might push it over. But [4] mentions under 2.5 as a possibility. Also, both teams to score 'No' could be a bet since Everton struggles to score (failed to score in 41% of matches). Corners: City might dominate possession, leading to more corners. Over 9.5 corners from [4] is a tip.\n\nPrediction: City should win, but Everton's defensive setup under Moyes might keep it close. Maybe 1-0 or 2-0 to City. Confidence level around 7/10.\n\nMy Say: Emphasize the David Moyes return narrative, Everton's last season at Goodison, City's quest for top four. Make it engaging with some historical context and key players.\n\nNeed to structure all this into the JSON format, ensuring citations are correctly applied. Check all stats against the sources and cite appropriately. Make sure to use the latest info, especially team news and form up to April 2025.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Everton host Manchester City at Goodison Park in a crucial Premier League clash with contrasting motivations.
