"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Everton vs Arsenal match. First, I need to structure the response according to the specified JSON format. Let's start with the match overview. From the search results, I see that Arsenal is favored with a 53.2% win probability according to Opta [1]. Everton's recent form isn't great, with only one win in eight matches [6]. Also, Arsenal has a strong away record, being unbeaten in 10 away Premier League games [1]. I should mention their defensive strength, conceding only 16 goals on the road since 2024 [1].\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line given is +0.5 for Everton. The search results suggest Arsenal's dominance, but Everton's home performance against Arsenal has been tough historically. However, recent form shows Arsenal's superiority. The Opta supercomputer's 53.2% win probability for Arsenal [1] and their 10-match unbeaten away streak support backing Arsenal on the Asian Handicap -0.5. The odds for Arsenal -0.5 are 1.93, which seems valuable if the model suggests a higher probability.\n\nKey player matchups: Martinelli vs Everton's defense. The previous analysis [3] showed Martinelli struggled against Ashley Young, but Young isn't in the predicted lineup. Instead, it's Mykolenko. Maybe focus on Martinelli's recent form. Also, Everton's midfield with Gueye and Garner against Arsenal's Rice and Odegaard. Rice's defensive stats could be crucial in breaking up Everton's play.\n\nTeam news: Everton's injuries include Calvert-Lewin and McNeil [6][8]. Arsenal's injuries include Gabriel Jesus, Havertz, Tomiyasu, and White [6][8]. The predicted lineups are provided, so I should list the injuries and suspensions accordingly, citing the sources [6][8].\n\nBetting insights: The under 2.5 goals market is supported by Everton's low xG and Arsenal's tight defense [11]. Both teams to score 'No' because Everton has struggled to score recently [6]. Corners over 9.5 as Arsenal averages high corners [2]. Use the stats from the sources to back these up.\n\nPrediction: Arsenal to win 2-0 based on their away form and Everton's scoring struggles. Confidence level 7/10 because of historical struggles at Goodison but current form favors Arsenal.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the clash between Everton's fight for survival and Arsenal's title hopes. Mention the historical context of Goodison Park being a tough venue but Arsenal's recent dominance. Use engaging language to set the scene.\n\nCitations: Need to ensure each fact is cited properly with the correct source indices. For example, Opta stats from [1], Everton's form from [6], injuries from [6][8], and xG data from [11].\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League clash pits 15th-placed Everton against 2nd-placed Arsenal at Goodison Park.
