While Real Madrid chase their 16th title, Arsenal seek their first, creating a compelling narrative of experience versus ambition[1][5]. Arsenal enter this tie on a seven-match unbeaten run (3W-4D), though their recent Premier League draws reveal defensive vulnerabilities exacerbated by key absences[3][7]. Real Madrid arrive having lost two of their last three competitive matches, but boast the tournament's second-best attack with 28 goals scored[4][7]. The Gunners' defensive crisis, missing four first-choice players including Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, clashes with Madrid's formidable frontline featuring Mbapp\u00e9 and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior[3][7]. This tactical duel at Emirates Stadium promises high stakes, with Arsenal's UCL hopes contrasting against Madrid's continental dominance[1][5].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Arsenal vs Real Madrid Champions League quarter-final. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results and structure it according to the JSON schema.\n\nStarting with the match overview. The user mentioned both teams are second in their leagues, but Real Madrid has a much better Champions League history. The search results [1] and [5] emphasize Real's experience compared to Arsenal's lack of titles. Recent form from [4] and [7] shows Arsenal's unbeaten streak and Real's recent losses. I should highlight the context of Arsenal's focus on Champions League due to being behind in the Premier League [5].\n\nNext, team news. The predicted lineups are given, but I need to check the injury reports. Search result [3] lists five Arsenal players ruled out: Tomiyasu, Havertz, Calafiori, Jesus, and Gabriel Magalhaes. That's crucial for the defense. Real Madrid's lineup from [7] includes Courtois, Vazquez, Rudiger, Mendy, Valverde, Camavinga, Rodrygo, Bellingham, Vinicius, and Mbappe. Wait, the user provided different predicted lineups. Need to cross-reference. The user's predicted lineups have Merino up front for Arsenal and Modric in midfield for Real. Maybe there are inconsistencies, but I should stick to the user's provided lineups unless there's conflicting info. The injuries from [3] are key for Arsenal's defense, so include those in team news.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.25 for Arsenal with 1.85 odds. Search result [4] mentions a 40% prediction for Home -0.5, which is a different line. [6] suggests under 2.5 goals. However, [1] recommends Both Teams to Score and Over 2.5. Need to reconcile this. The Asian Handicap in the user's query is -0.25, which is a split line, so half the stake on -0 and half on -0.5. Arsenal's recent form is mixed with draws, while Real has more wins but recent losses. Using stats from [4], Arsenal's home form and Real's away form (70% Over 2.5 goals). The handicap analysis should compare form, H2H, and value. Maybe lean towards Real Madrid +0.25 given their attacking players and Arsenal's defensive injuries.\n\nKey player matchups. Look at the predicted lineups. Saka vs Fran Garcia could be a mismatch. From [7], Real's attack includes Mbappe and Vinicius against Arsenal's defense missing Gabriel. Martinelli vs Vazquez on the left. Odegaard vs Modric in midfield. These duels are critical. Using xG stats from [2], Arsenal's xG is 1.82 vs Real's 1.39. But with Arsenal's defense weakened, Real's attack might exploit that.\n\nBetting insights. From the search results, [1] suggests BTTS and Over 2.5. [4] predicts Under 2.5. There's a conflict here. Need to check both teams' BTTS stats. [4] says Arsenal has 50% BTTS in last 10, Real 70%. So BTTS Yes could be a good bet. Also, considering the Asian Handicap value, maybe Real +0.25 at 2.08 odds offers value. Another insight could be Mbappe to score, given Arsenal's defensive issues. Or maybe corners, as Arsenal might push forward.\n\nPrediction. Considering injuries and Real's attack, a 2-1 win for Real Madrid. Confidence level around 7/10. Reasoning based on Arsenal's defensive absences and Real's firepower.\n\nMy Say. Need to craft a engaging narrative. Highlight the clash of Arsenal's young squad vs Real's experience. Mention key players like Saka and Mbappe. Use vivid language to set the scene at Emirates.\n\nCitations are crucial. Every fact needs a source. For example, Gabriel's injury is from [3], Arsenal's xG from [2], etc. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered and corresponds to the sources listed.\n\nNeed to structure all this into the JSON format, ensuring all sections are covered with accurate data and proper citations. Double-check the odds and markets, using decimal format as specified. Avoid any markdown and stick to the schema.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"The Champions League quarter-final clash between Arsenal and Real Madrid presents a fascinating contrast in European pedigree.
