    "match_overview": "Inter Milan host Bayern Munich at San Siro holding a 2-1 aggregate lead in this Champions League quarter-final second leg. Simone Inzaghi's side demonstrated tactical mastery in Munich, absorbing Bayern's 2.30 xG onslaught while converting limited chances through lethal counterattacks[6][4]. The Nerazzurri remain unbeaten in 12 matches across all competitions, showcasing Europe's stingiest defense with just three UCL goals conceded this campaign[1][8]. Bayern face their ultimate test of Vincent Kompany's tenure - needing to breach Inter's organized 5-3-2 low block while mitigating threats from Thuram and Mart\u00ednez's electric partnership. Historical trends favor the Germans at San Siro (three straight group stage wins), but Inter's current defensive resolve (one home UCL goal conceded) suggests a tactical chess match awaits[1][3].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Inter Milan vs. Bayern Munich Champions League match. First, I need to make sure I follow all the guidelines and structure properly. The user wants a detailed JSON response with specific sections, so I need to parse the query carefully.\n\nStarting with the match overview. The user mentioned using live sourced info, so I'll check the search results provided. The first leg result was 2-1 to Inter, and they're leading the aggregate. From [1], Inter's defensive record is strong, only conceding three goals in the Champions League. Bayern dominated the first leg in xG [6], but lost. That's a key point for the overview.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is 0, which means it's a pick'em. The odds are 2.04 for Inter and 1.88 for Bayern. I need to compare this with the models. [6] says Opta's supercomputer gives Inter a 72% chance to advance, but the match itself might be closer. Inter's home form is strong, unbeaten in 14 UCL home games [8]. Bayern's away form isn't as good, only three wins in nine away UCL games [8]. So maybe Inter has value here. But the line is 0, so if the model thinks Inter has a higher chance, the 2.04 odds might be valuable. Also, considering the first leg xG, Bayern might push hard, but Inter's defense is solid.\n\nKey player matchups. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez is in form, scoring in four straight UCL games [7]. His matchup against Bayern's center-backs, maybe Kim Min-Jae and Dier. From the lineups, Bayern's defense is makeshift with Stanisic and Laimer as fullbacks. Thuram and Mart\u00ednez could exploit that. For Bayern, Harry Kane needs to be sharp. He was quiet in the first leg but is a key scorer. Kimmich vs. Calhanoglu in midfield could be crucial for controlling the game.\n\nTeam news. The predicted lineups are given, but I need to check injuries. From [1], Bayern might be missing Davies and Upamecano, but the lineups provided have Stanisic and Laimer, so maybe those are the absences. Inter's lineup seems settled. Need to structure injuries and suspensions based on the search results. [4] mentions Davies and Upamecano are out, so that's part of Bayern's injuries. Inter's team news from the lineups looks full strength.\n\nBetting insights. Look for value in the markets. Inter's moneyline at +170 [4] which is 2.70 in decimal. The Asian Handicap Home 0 at 2.04 might be value if the model thinks they have a higher chance. Also, under 2.5 goals because Inter's defense is strong. Lautaro anytime scorer is a good prop bet [4][7]. Both teams to score? The first leg had both scoring, but Inter's defense is tight. Maybe no, but the prediction from [8] says 1-1, so BTTS could be a pick.\n\nPrediction. The user's example in [1] predicts 1-1, but [4] thinks Inter wins 1-0. Opta's model gives Inter a 72% chance to advance, but the match could be a draw. Maybe 1-1 with Inter advancing on aggregate. But the actual match result prediction needs to be clear.\n\nMy Say. Need to weave in the narrative. Inter's defensive resilience vs. Bayern's attacking might. The historical context from [1] about past meetings. Mention key players and the stakes. Make it engaging, maybe reference the first leg drama.\n\nCitations are crucial. Every fact needs a source. For example, Inter's defensive record comes from [1], Opta's model from [6], Bayern's away form from [8], etc. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered and only from the provided search results.\n\nDouble-check the Asian Handicap line. The user specified it's 0, so the analysis must reflect that. The home odds are 2.04, away 1.88. If the model thinks Inter has a higher probability, then 2.04 is value. But need to balance with Bayern's need to attack, which might open them up for counters.\n\nInjuries: From [4], Bayern missing Davies and Upamecano. In the structured team news, list those under Bayern's injuries. Inter's lineup seems intact, so maybe no major injuries.\n\nPutting it all together, structure each section with the required data, cite sources properly, and ensure the JSON format is exact. Avoid lists, use narrative. Make sure the betting insights are actionable and based on the data from the sources.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Inter Milan host Bayern Munich at San Siro holding a 2-1 aggregate lead in this Champions League quarter-final second leg.
