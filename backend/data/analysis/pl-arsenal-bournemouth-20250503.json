    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Arsenal vs Bournemouth. First, I need to gather all the relevant data from the provided search results and structure it according to the user's requirements.\n\nStarting with the match overview. Arsenal are 2nd in the league with 68 points, while Bournemouth are 10th with 50 points. Arsenal's home form is excellent, with 10 wins, 6 draws, and 1 loss. Bournemouth's away form is decent, 6 wins, 7 draws, 4 losses. Recent form: Arsenal drew with Crystal Palace and beat Ipswich, while Bournemouth drew with Man United and Crystal Palace. Head-to-head, Arsenal have won the last seven home games against Bournemouth. That's a strong point for Arsenal's dominance at home.\n\nNext, Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.25 for Arsenal at 1.86 odds. From the search results, BetMGM mentions Arsenal as -0.5 favorites but the user-provided line is -0.25. The model from Dimers.com gives Arsenal a 62.5% chance, which translates to implied odds around 1.60. The bookmaker's 1.86 offers value here. Also, Bournemouth's high BTTS rate (76% away) and Arsenal's defensive injuries might make the handicap tricky. But Arsenal's xG is higher, so maybe value on Arsenal -0.25.\n\nKey player matchups: Trossard vs Adam Smith. Trossard has high xG, and Smith's defensive stats might struggle. Rice vs Scott in midfield. Rice's defensive stats could disrupt Scott's creativity. Saliba vs Evanilson. Saliba's strong defensive numbers against Evanilson's goal contribution.\n\nTeam news: Arsenal's injuries include Gabriel, Jesus, Calafiori, Jorginho. Bournemouth missing Unal and Christie. Using the provided lineups, Arsenal's defense is weakened but still solid with Saliba and Kiwior. Bournemouth's lineup has Kerkez and Zabarnyi, but their defense might be vulnerable.\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Asian Handicap Arsenal -0.25 at 1.86. Model suggests 62.5% chance (1.60 odds), so value.\n2. Over 2.5 goals. Bournemouth's away games average 3.41 goals, Arsenal's home games 2.82. Combined, high chance for over.\n3. Both Teams to Score. Bournemouth's 76% away BTTS and Arsenal's defensive injuries support this.\n\nPrediction: Arsenal 2-1. They have the edge at home but Bournemouth's attack can exploit defensive absences.\n\nMy Say: Highlight Arsenal's title disappointment and focus on Champions League, Bournemouth's fight for Conference League. Mention the tactical battles and key players. Make it engaging with a narrative about Arsenal's resilience and Bournemouth's underdog spirit.\n\nCheck all citations against the search results to ensure accuracy. Use the provided sources for stats, injuries, and predictions. Make sure each fact is backed by a source index. Avoid any markdown and follow JSON structure strictly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Arsenal enter this fixture 2nd in the Premier League (68pts) with Bournemouth 10th (50pts).
