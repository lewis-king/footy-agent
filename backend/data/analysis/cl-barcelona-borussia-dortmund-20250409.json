    "match_overview": "Barcelona host Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League quarterfinal first leg clash between teams at opposite ends of the form spectrum. The Catalans come into this match on a 15-game unbeaten run across all competitions, having scored 2.47 xG per game in their recent La Liga matches[2][7]. Hansi Flick's side demonstrated their European credentials with a dominant xG of 1.26 in their away win at Benfica last month[7]. Dortmund arrive in Catalonia winless in their last three Bundesliga matches, carrying defensive vulnerabilities evidenced by their 1.26 xG against per game this season[3]. The German side's 3-2 loss in the reverse fixture at Signal Iduna Park[1] highlighted their susceptibility to Barcelona's attacking transitions, particularly through teenage sensation Lamine Yamal who's created 2.4 chances per 90 in UCL play[6].",

With Dortmund's defense missing its spine and Barcelona's high wire act between control and chaos, this tie may hinge on whether Guirassy can channel his 0.69 goals/90[3] against Bar\u00e7a's makeshift backline. One things certain - between Yamal's audacity, Lewandowski's poaching, and Dortmund's counterattacking verve, the Olympic Stadium promises 90 minutes of edge-of-seat European drama."

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Barcelona vs Borussia Dortmund Champions League match. First, I need to structure the response according to the specified JSON schema. The user provided a lot of search results, so I should extract relevant data from there.\n\nStarting with the match overview: Barcelona is in good form, on a treble chase, and won their last encounter 3-2. Dortmund is struggling in the Bundesliga and has key players injured like Sabitzer and Schlotterbeck. From source [1], Barcelona's key players are Yamal, Lewandowski, and Raphinha, while Dortmund is missing Gross, Sabitzer, and Schlotterbeck. Also, source [5] mentions Dortmund's predicted lineup and their reliance on Guirassy.\n\nFor team news, the user provided predicted lineups, so I'll use those. Injuries and suspensions are mentioned in [1] for Dortmund: Gross suspended, Sabitzer and Schlotterbeck injured. Barcelona's Olmo is out. Wait, in the user's predicted lineup, Martinez is starting for Barcelona, but in [6], Inigo Martinez is listed as out. Need to check that. Oh, the user's lineup has Martinez, but source [6] says he's out. That's a conflict. Maybe the user's info is more recent? Or perhaps a mistake. I'll note Martinez as a doubt based on [6].\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -1.75 for Barcelona. From [4], the best odds are -1.5 at -115, but the user provided line is -1.75. Using stats from [2] and [3], Barcelona's xG is high, and Dortmund's defense is weak. Barcelona's home form is strong, and Dortmund's away form is mixed. The analysis should compare form, H2H, and value. Source [6] suggests Barcelona to win HT/FT, which supports a strong home performance.\n\nKey player matchups: Lewandowski vs Dortmund's defense, which is missing key defenders. From [5], Guirassy is a threat. Also, Yamal's pace against Dortmund's full-backs. Source [6] mentions Adeyemi and Guirassy as dangers for Dortmund.\n\nBetting insights: Over 3.5 goals is suggested in [6] due to defensive issues. Barcelona HT/FT at -110 from [6]. Also, considering Asian Handicap -1.75 based on Barcelona's dominance. Using xG stats from [2] and [7], Barcelona's high xG supports this.\n\nPrediction: Barcelona to win 3-1, confidence 7/10. Reasoning from their attack strength and Dortmund's defensive absences.\n\nMy say: Highlight the clash of Barcelona's treble ambitions vs Dortmund's desperate situation. Emphasize key players and tactical points from the sources.\n\nCitations: Need to map each source used. For example, injuries from [1], xG from [2][3][7], lineup from [5], betting odds from [4][6]. Make sure each fact is cited properly with the right source indices.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Barcelona host Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League quarterfinal first leg clash between teams at opposite ends of the form spectrum.
