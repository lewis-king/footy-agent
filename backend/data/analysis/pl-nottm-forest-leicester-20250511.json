Forest have won 9 home games this season [13] but come off a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace where they lost defender Murillo to injury [9]. Leicester's 2-0 win against Southampton ended a 5-game losing streak but they've collected just 1 point from their last 6 away matches [11]. Historically, Forest edge the H2H 42-41 [8], winning 3 of the last 4 meetings including a 3-1 away victory in October 2024 [8].",

Watch for Gibbs-White to orchestrate attacks through Leicester's porous left channel [12], where Kristiansen's 1.3 tackles/90 [15] could see Elanga's pace prove decisive. In a game balancing on the knife-edge of aspiration and desperation, Forest's set-piece prowess (12 goals [13]) against Leicester's zonal marking frailties (63% conceded from dead balls [15]) may write the final chapter.",
    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Nottingham Forest vs Leicester City Premier League match on May 11, 2025. Let's start by going through the provided search results to gather the necessary information.\n\nFirst, looking at the fixture information from [1], Nottingham Forest is playing at home against Leicester. The current form from [2] shows Forest's recent form as D-L-L-W-L-L, which is inconsistent. They're 6th in the league with 61 points. Leicester, according to [5] and [11], is 19th with 21 points, already relegated. Their form is W-L-L-D-L-L, which is poor, especially away.\n\nTeam news is crucial. From [9], Forest has injuries: Callum Hudson-Odoi is out, and Murillo might be injured. Leicester's lineup from [6] shows key players like Jamie Vardy and Stephy Mavididi. The predicted lineups are provided, so I'll use those.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -1.5 for Forest at 2.05 odds. I need to check if this offers value. Leicester's away form is terrible, with only 1 point in the last six away games [16]. Forest's home defense is strong, conceding only 13 goals at home [13]. The handicap seems feasible given Leicester's struggles.\n\nKey player matchups: Chris Wood (Forest) vs Leicester's defense. Wood has 22 goals [2], and Leicester has conceded 76 goals [15]. Also, Morgan Gibbs-White's creativity against Leicester's midfield.\n\nBetting insights: Looking at [10], Dimers gives Forest a 63.4% chance to win, which translates to 1.58 odds. The bookmaker offers 2.05, which is higher, indicating value. Also, over 2.5 goals is likely as both teams have high over percentages [2][5].\n\nPrediction: Forest should win, but considering the -1.5 handicap, their recent form is shaky. However, Leicester's poor defense might lead to a 2-0 Forest win.\n\nIn 'my_say', I need to highlight the clash between Forest's European hopes and Leicester's relegation, key players, and the tactical aspects. Make it engaging and story-driven.\n\nCitations: Ensure each fact is cited correctly. For example, Forest's home form from [13], Leicester's away stats from [11], etc. Need to check all sources and link them properly.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the required JSON format, making sure all sections are covered with accurate data and citations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Nottingham Forest (6th, 61 points) host relegated Leicester City (19th, 21 points) in a crucial Premier League clash.
