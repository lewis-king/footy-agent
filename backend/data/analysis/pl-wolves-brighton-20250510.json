    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this betting analysis for the Wolves vs Brighton match. Let's start by going through the user's query and the provided search results to gather all necessary information. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market. \n\nFirst, the match overview. Wolves are in decent form, especially under Pereira. The search results mention they've had a turnaround since December, with improved xG and defensive stats. They're 13th but have won 8 of their last 12. Brighton is 10th, fighting for Europe. Their away form isn't great, and they've had issues keeping clean sheets on the road. Recent H2H is mixed; the reverse fixture was a 2-2 draw. \n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is +0.0 with home odds 2.08 and away 1.95. I need to compare the implied probabilities. Wolves' implied probability is 1/2.08 \u2248 48.08%, Brighton's 1/1.95 \u2248 51.28%. But according to the simulations from Dimers (source 8), Wolves have a 38.6% chance to win, Brighton 36.2%, with a 25.2% draw. The model suggests a close game. The Asian Handicap line being 0 means it's essentially a pick'em. Given Wolves' home form and Brighton's away struggles, maybe there's value in Wolves +0.0. But the odds are tight. Wait, the user mentioned that when odds are near evens, consider the line for supremacy. The home advantage might tilt it.\n\nKey player matchups: Cunha vs Dunk. Cunha is Wolves' main threat, and Dunk is Brighton's stalwart. A\u00eft-Nouri vs Mitoma could be crucial on the wings. Also, Welbeck's experience against Wolves' defense.\n\nTeam news: Wolves have Strand Larsen back from injury (source 10), which is a boost. They're missing Kalajdzic, Gonzalez, Mosquera, Chiwone, and Johnstone. Brighton is without Pedro due to suspension (source 10), and Mitoma might return. March and Kadioglu are doubtful.\n\nBetting insights: Both teams to score is strong here. Brighton's BTTS stats are high (source 6). Wolves have scored in their last six home games. The Asian Handicap line at 0 with Wolves' home form might offer value. Also, considering the over 2.5 goals given both teams' attacking tendencies.\n\nPrediction: A close game, maybe 1-1. But Wolves' recent form at home could edge it. However, the model from source 8 suggests a draw is the most likely correct score. So maybe 1-1 with Wolves +0.0 being a push, but the value might be on Brighton given the odds?\n\nWait, the user provided the Asian Handicap line as +0.0. So if the line is 0, it's a pick'em. If the match ends in a draw, the bet is refunded. So recommending Wolves +0.0 at 2.08 if we think they have a higher chance than implied. The model says 38.6% chance for Wolves, which is lower than the implied 48.08%. So maybe the bookies are overvaluing Wolves? But the user's example was about when the model's probability is higher than the implied. Here, it's the opposite. So maybe Brighton +0.0 at 1.95 is better? Their implied probability is 51.28%, but the model gives them 36.2% win probability. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user's example was when the model's probability is higher than the bookmaker's implied. In this case, the model's probability for Wolves is 38.6%, which is lower than the implied 48.08%, meaning the bookies are offering worse odds than the model suggests. So maybe there's no value on Wolves. But Brighton's model probability is 36.2%, implied is 51.28% (1/1.95), so the bookies think Brighton has a higher chance than the model. So perhaps the value is on Wolves or the draw. But the user's task is to find value where the model's probability is higher than the implied. Since the model's probability for Wolves is 38.6% vs implied 48.08%, that's not a value. Wait, no, the implied probability for Wolves to win (not the Asian Handicap) is different. Wait, the Asian Handicap here is +0.0, which is essentially a pick'em where if the match is a draw, stakes are refunded. So the actual probability for Wolves to win is 38.6%, draw 25.2%, Brighton 36.2%. The Asian Handicap +0.0 for Wolves at 2.08 implies that if Wolves win, you get the payout. If it's a draw, you get the stake back. So the implied probability for Wolves is 1/2.08 \u2248 48.08%, but the model says they have a 38.6% chance. That means the bookies are offering higher odds than the model's probability, which would be a negative value. Wait, no, the implied probability is higher than the model's, meaning the bookies think Wolves have a higher chance than they do. So the value would be on the opposite side. But the Asian Handicap is a two-way market. So if the model says Wolves have a 38.6% chance to win, and the implied probability is 48.08%, then the value is on Brighton +0.0 at 1.95, which has an implied probability of 51.28% (1/1.95). But the model gives Brighton a 36.2% chance to win. So neither side offers value. Hmm, maybe the draw is the value? The model gives a 25.2% chance, which would imply odds of about 3.97 (1/0.252). The actual draw odds are +245 (source 8), which is 3.45 in decimal. So the model's probability is higher than the implied, meaning there's value in the draw. But the user's task is to focus on Asian Handicap. Alternatively, maybe the value is in both teams to score, which has a high probability based on the sources. \n\nIn the betting insights, both teams to score is recommended by source 6, with Brighton having BTTS in 25 matches. Also, Wolves have scored in their last six home games. The odds for BTTS are -175 (source 4), which is 1.57 in decimal. The implied probability is 63.7% (1/1.57). If the model suggests a higher probability, then it's a value. But without the model's exact BTTS probability, but based on the sources, it's a strong bet.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap, perhaps the analysis should lean towards Brighton +0.0 given their slight edge in the model, but the odds are close. Alternatively, considering Wolves' home form and Brighton's away struggles, maybe Wolves +0.0 is better. The confusion here is reconciling the model's probabilities with the Asian Handicap line. \n\nIn the team news, Wolves have Strand Larsen back, which is a boost. Brighton missing Joao Pedro but might have Mitoma back. \n\nThe prediction: The model from Dimers (source 8) suggests a 1-1 draw as the most likely correct score. So perhaps a draw is the prediction, but in the Asian Handicap, a draw would refund the stake. So the recommendation might be to avoid the Asian Handicap and look at other markets. However, the user insists on focusing on the Asian Handicap. Given that, if the line is 0, and the model thinks it's close, maybe the value is on Brighton +0.0 at 1.95, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering Wolves' home form and Brighton's away record, maybe Wolves +0.0 at 2.08 offers value. \n\nThe key is to present the data clearly, cite the sources, and make a recommendation based on the available information. Also, ensure that all facts are sourced from the provided search results and not from prior knowledge.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Wolves enter this fixture in strong form under manager Vitor Pereira, boasting 8 wins from their last 12 matches (WWWWW form) with improved attacking output (1.3 xG/90) and defensive stability (1.4 xGA/90) since December [2][5].
