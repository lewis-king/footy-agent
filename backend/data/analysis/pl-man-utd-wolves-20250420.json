United sit 14th with just 10 wins from 32 matches, showing poor defensive metrics (1.41 goals conceded per game) and the league's third-worst expected goals against (xGA) at 1.37[1][2]. Wolves under Vitor Pereira have been transformed since December, climbing to 8th in the form table with 4 consecutive wins including a 4-2 demolition of Tottenham[3][8]. This tactical revolution has seen Wolves average 2.19 goals per game since switching to a 3-4-3 system[3][8].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Man Utd vs. Wolves match. First, I need to go through all the provided search results to gather the latest data. \n\nStarting with Manchester United's form, the FootyStats [1] shows they're 14th in the league with 10 wins, 8 draws, and 14 losses. Their home form is average, with 6 wins, 3 draws, and 7 losses. They've scored 38 goals but conceded 45, leading to a negative goal difference. Their xG stats are around 1.49 for and 1.37 against. The recent form is poor, which is crucial for the match overview.\n\nWolves' form under Vitor Pereira since his appointment is impressive. The Football365 article [3] mentions they're 8th in the form table since he took over, just two points behind Man City. They've beaten Tottenham 4-2 [8], showing strong attacking prowess. Their switch to a 3-4-3 formation with Emmanuel Agbadou in defense and Andre in midfield has been key. Matheus Cunha's return from suspension adds firepower.\n\nLooking at the head-to-head, the xGscore [4] from their December 2024 meeting shows Wolves had a higher xG (0.91 vs. 0.49) and won 2-0. This indicates Wolves might have an edge, but recent form changes things. The Dimers prediction [6][7] gives Man Utd a slight edge at 52% win probability, but their model might not fully account for Wolves' recent surge.\n\nInjuries and lineups: Man Utd's predicted lineup includes Lindelof and Mazraoui in defense. Their defense has been shaky, conceding 1.41 goals per match [1]. Wolves' lineup has Agbadou in a back three, which has stabilized their defense. Andre in midfield could dominate against Eriksen and Ugarte.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -0.25 for Man Utd with odds 2.08. Wolves' recent form (4 wins in a row) and United's inconsistency suggest value on Wolves +0.25 at 1.86. The implied probability for Wolves +0.25 is around 53.76% (1/1.86), but their actual chance might be higher given their form. This makes the away handicap a value bet.\n\nKey player matchups: Bruno Fernandes vs. Andre in midfield. Fernandes has creativity, but Andre's defensive stats could neutralize him. Ait-Nouri against Dalot on the flank; Ait-Nouri's pace and recent goal [8] might exploit Dalot's defensive weaknesses.\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Wolves +0.25 Asian Handicap at 1.86 offers value.\n2. Over 2.5 goals at 1.80 (from search results [5]) is likely, as both teams have attacking threats but weak defenses.\n3. Both Teams to Score (BTTS) Yes at 1.70 (from [5]) given United's 44% BTTS rate and Wolves' recent scoring form.\n\nPrediction: Wolves might edge this 2-1. Their recent form and tactical setup under Pereira could overpower United's inconsistent defense. However, Dimers' model slightly favors United, so a draw is also possible. Confidence level 7/10.\n\nMy Say: Highlight Wolves' resurgence under Pereira, their tactical discipline, and United's struggle for identity. Emphasize the clash of styles and key battles in midfield and wings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Manchester United host Wolves at Old Trafford in a crucial Premier League clash between two teams at opposite ends of the form spectrum.
