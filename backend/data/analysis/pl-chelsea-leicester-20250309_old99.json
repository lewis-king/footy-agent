    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for Chelsea vs Leicester. First, I need to review all the provided search results and extract the relevant data.\n\nStarting with the match overview, Chelsea is 5th with 46 points, and Leicester is 19th with 17 points. Recent form: Chelsea has a mixed record (WWDLW), but they have key players returning from injury like Fofana and Chalobah. Leicester's form is poor, with 6 losses in their last 7 games. Head-to-head, Chelsea dominates, winning the last four meetings. Sources [1][5][7] support this.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is 0 with both teams at 1.90 odds. Chelsea's expected goals (xG) is 2.57, and they have a high probability of winning (77% according to [6][10]). Leicester struggles defensively, conceding 61 goals. Chelsea's offense is strong, scoring 21 goals in last 10 games. The recommendation here is Chelsea -0 AH at 1.90, as they're likely to cover the handicap. Sources [4][6][9] back this up.\n\nKey player matchups: Cole Palmer vs Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Palmer's creativity (7 goals, 5 assists) against Dewsbury-Hall's defensive issues. Then, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez vs Wilfred Ndidi. Fern\u00e1ndez's recent form (goal and assist in last match) against Ndidi's inconsistent tackling. Sources [5][8][13] mention these players.\n\nTeam news: Chelsea's injuries include Madueke, Jackson, and Guiu, but Fofana and Chalobah are back. Projected XI from [3][13] includes Jorgensen, Gusto, Fofana, Colwill, Cucurella, Caicedo, Fern\u00e1ndez, Sancho, Palmer, Nkunku, Neto. Leicester's Fatawu is out, Pereira doubtful. Their lineup from [14] has Hermansen, Justin, Faes, Souttar, Kristiansen, Ndidi, Winks, McAteer, Dewsbury-Hall, Mavididi, Vardy.\n\nBetting insights: Chelsea to win & Over 3.5 goals. Their games average over 3 goals, and Leicester's defensive issues. Both Teams to Score: Yes, as Chelsea's defense isn't airtight. Correct Score 3-1 Chelsea, considering their scoring form. Sources [1][4][9] support these.\n\nPrediction: Chelsea 3-1 Leicester. They have the form, home advantage, and key players returning. Leicester's poor away record and defensive woes make a comeback unlikely. Source [7] even predicts a 3-0.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the contrast between Chelsea's European aspirations and Leicester's relegation battle. Use vivid imagery like \"foxes backed into a corner\" and \"Stamford Bridge's fortress.\" Mention Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez as a key player and Chelsea's attacking potential. Sources [5][9][13] provide context here.\n\nNeed to ensure all sources are cited correctly, especially for stats like xG, injuries, and form. Check odds are in decimal format as per guidelines. Make sure the JSON structure is exact, with all required fields filled accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea (5th, 46pts) host relegation-threatened Leicester (19th, 17pts) at Stamford Bridge in a clash of contrasting ambitions.
