Wolves enter with 4 losses in their last 6 matches (LDWLW) while Everton remain unbeaten in 7 (WDLWD), creating a fascinating contrast in momentum. Historically, Wolves hold a slight H2H edge (8-7-6) but suffered a 4-0 defeat in December's reverse fixture[3][8]. With Wolves averaging 1.37 goals scored/2.07 conceded vs Everton's 1.11 scored/1.26 conceded[6], this match presents critical implications for relegation survival and mid-table aspirations[1][4].",

Everton's Moyes rules out Ndiaye (ankle), McNeil (knee) and Calvert-Lewin (groin) until April, though Coleman (calf) could make the bench after full training[1].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Wolves vs Everton Premier League match on March 8, 2025. The user specified several sections to include: match overview, team news, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, betting insights, and a final score prediction. All of this needs to be in a strict JSON format as outlined.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the search results provided. The first source [1] gives a preview of the match, mentioning Wolves are trying to avoid relegation while Everton is resurgent under David Moyes. Key injuries and suspensions are noted, especially Matheus Cunha's suspension for Wolves. Everton has several players out but Seamus Coleman might return. The projected lineups are provided here, which is useful for the team news section.\n\nNext, source [2] discusses Asian handicap, favoring Everton +0.25 with 28% probability. It also provides recent form stats: Wolves 40% win rate last 10, Everton 50%. Both teams have 50% BTTS and Over 2.5 goals. This will help in the Asian handicap analysis and betting insights.\n\nSource [3] gives H2H stats. Wolves have 8 wins, Everton 7, 6 draws. Average goals 2.48 per match. Recent H2H shows 4 matches without BTTS. This is important for head-to-head analysis in the overview and predicting BTTS markets.\n\nSource [4] offers predictions, favoring Everton moneyline. They mention Everton's form under Moyes: 4 wins, 3 draws in last 7. Wolves' home games have 69.2% Over 2.5. This can inform the Over/Under analysis and match prediction.\n\nSource [5] predicts a 1-1 draw, noting both teams' styles and low conversion rates. It suggests BTTS Yes and Under 2.5. This could influence the betting insights and final score prediction.\n\nSource [6] discusses both teams' struggles and managerial changes. It notes Wolves' higher goals conceded, which might affect the Over/Under analysis.\n\nSource [7] provides odds: Wolves 2.65, Draw 3.20, Everton 2.90. Over 2.5 is 2.30, Under 1.67. The prediction here is 1-1, which aligns with source [5].\n\nSource [8] mentions Everton's unbeaten streak of 7 matches and Wolves' poor form. Key player Rayan Ait-Nouri is highlighted. This can be used in key player matchups.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n1. **Match Overview**: Highlight Wolves' relegation battle vs Everton's resurgence. Mention recent form and H2H stats. Use sources [1], [3], [8].\n\n2. **Team News**: Detail suspensions (Cunha) and injuries for Wolves. Everton's absentees (Ndiaye, McNeil, Calvert-Lewin) and possible return of Coleman. Use source [1] for structured team news.\n\n3. **Asian Handicap Analysis**: Compare recent form, home/away stats. Source [2] suggests Everton +0.25 but given the line is 0, might lean towards Everton. Use form data from [2], [4], [8].\n\n4. **Key Player Matchups**: Ait-Nouri vs Everton's defense (source [8]). Also, Bellegarde vs Everton's midfield. Use data on how these players influence the game.\n\n5. **Betting Insights**: Match result - Everton value (source [4]), BTTS Yes (sources [2], [5]), Under 2.5 (sources [4], [5], [6]). Corners market based on Wolves' attacking fullbacks (source [8]).\n\n6. **Prediction**: 1-2 Everton with confidence 7/10. Reasoning based on Everton's form and Wolves' defensive issues (sources [4], [6], [8]).\n\nNeed to ensure all data points are cited correctly with the source indices. Also, check JSON structure against the user's schema to ensure compliance. Make sure all 'raw' fields have detailed analysis as per instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This crucial Premier League clash pits 17th-placed Wolves against 16th-positioned Everton, separated by 10 points in the table.
