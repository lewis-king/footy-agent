Wolves enter on a five-match winning streak \u2013 including a 1-0 victory at Manchester United \u2013 with their defensive organization (3 clean sheets in 5 games) and clinical finishing (48.21 xG in 2023/24 [5]) proving decisive. Leicester's relegation was mathematically confirmed last weekend after a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, extending their winless run to 11 matches. The Foxes have scored just 24 goals all season \u2013 the league's second-worst attack \u2013 while conceding a division-high 73 [7].

Marvel at 15-year-old Jeremy Monga, Leicester's desperate Hail Mary in a lost cause. This isn't just a match; it's a changing of the guard set to the primal roar of the South Bank.

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Wolves vs Leicester Premier League match. First, I need to make sure I follow all the guidelines and structure the JSON properly. Let's start by breaking down each section as per the user's request.\n\n**Match Overview**: Wolves are on a five-game winning streak, including a recent win against Manchester United. Leicester's relegation was confirmed after losing to Liverpool. Head-to-head, Wolves won the reverse fixture 3-0. I should mention Wolves' form, Leicester's struggles, and the context of Leicester already being relegated.\n\n**Asian Handicap Analysis**: The line is -1.0 for Wolves at 1.94. Need to compare their recent performance against the spread. Wolves have covered in 56.1% of matches, Leicester 47%. Wolves' home form is 50% ATS. Recent wins by two goals against Tottenham and Southampton. Leicester's away form is poor, with 10 losses in 11. The model from source [3] predicts 1-0 and 2-0 as likely. Value here since Wolves have been winning by margins, so -1.0 at 1.94 seems good.\n\n**Key Player Matchups**: Matheus Cunha vs Leicester's defense. He has 14 goals, facing a weak defense. Larsen's form with 5 goals in 5 games. Leicester's Daka vs Wolves' defense which has kept clean sheets. Mention Cunha's scoring odds from [6] and Larsen's anytime scorer odds.\n\n**Team News**: Use the provided lineups. Injuries from [1] and [9]. Wolves have Sa doubtful, Bentley in goal. Leicester's Fatawu out, Winks not playing. Projected lineups are given, but need to check sources for accuracy. Mention injuries and how they affect the teams.\n\n**Betting Insights**: \n1. Asian Handicap Wolves -1.0 at 1.94. Source [6] recommends -1.5 at 2.42, but our line is better. \n2. Under 2.5 goals at 2.00. Wolves' low xG per shot [5], Leicester's poor scoring. \n3. Larsen to score anytime at 2.50 [6]. \n4. Correct score 2-0 at 8.00 [3]. \n5. Wolves to win both halves at 3.75. Their recent form supports this.\n\n**Prediction**: 2-0 Wolves. Confidence from their form, Leicester's lack of motivation, and defensive issues.\n\n**My Say**: Highlight Wolves' resurgence under Pereira, Leicester's dismal season, and the excitement of Wolves chasing a record. Use vivid language to set the scene at Molineux.\n\nNeed to ensure all facts are sourced from the provided search results. Check each stat against the sources. For example, Wolves' ATS from [7], xG from [5], correct score from [3], etc. Cite sources properly in brackets. Make sure the JSON structure matches exactly, with correct headers and nesting. Avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON format. Double-check odds and recommendations against the sources to ensure accuracy. Finally, make sure the analysis is data-driven and not based on general knowledge, using only the provided search results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Wolverhampton Wanderers host relegated Leicester City at Molineux in a fixture contrasting two starkly different trajectories.
