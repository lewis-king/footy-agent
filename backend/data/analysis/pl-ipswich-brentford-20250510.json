    "match_overview": "Ipswich Town, already relegated with the league's worst home record (4W-13L), host Brentford who sit 9th and eye a top-half finish. Brentford arrive on a 3-match winning streak (including a 4-3 thriller vs Manchester United) while Ipswich have lost 7 consecutive home games - a club record[3][13]. Historically, Brentford dominate this fixture with 5 wins in the last 11 H2Hs including a 4-3 reverse fixture victory[5][15]. Ipswich's defensive woes (1.16 home xG conceded, league-worst[1]) contrast sharply with Brentford's clinical attack (1.38 away xG[4]).",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Ipswich vs Brentford. First, I need to gather all the relevant data from the provided search results. \n\nStarting with the match overview: Ipswich is already relegated, sitting 18th with 22 points, while Brentford is 9th aiming for a higher finish. Recent form shows Ipswich has 1 win in 5, Brentford with 3 consecutive wins. Head-to-head, Brentford leads 5-2 in the last 11 meetings. The reverse fixture was a 4-3 Brentford win. That gives context on team motivation and historical performance.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is +1.0 for Ipswich at 2.02 and -1.0 for Brentford at 1.88. From the stats, Ipswich's home xG is 1.10 (worst in the league) and they concede 1.16 at home. Brentford's away xG is 1.38. Ipswich's home form is terrible, 4 wins in 17, while Brentford's away form is decent. The handicap seems to favor Brentford, but the odds might not reflect the true probability. The model suggests a 57.8% chance for Brentford, which translates to odds around 1.73, but the bookies offer 1.88, indicating value on Brentford -1.0.\n\nKey player matchups: Brentford's Mbeumo and Wissa each have 18 goals. Ipswich's Delap is their main threat. Mbeumo vs Ipswich's defense, which is weak, especially without Davis. Also, Damsgaard's creativity against Ipswich's midfield without suspended players.\n\nTeam news: Ipswich has multiple injuries and suspensions. Davis is suspended, Muric, Burns, Broadhead, Townsend, Philogene, Szmodics, Ogbene out. Brentford's Thiago is back but won't start, Hickey nearing return. Janelt, Carvalho, Dasilva out. Lineups as provided in the prompt.\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Brentford -1.0 AH at 1.88 offers value. Their recent form and Ipswich's defensive issues support this.\n2. Over 2.5 goals at 1.50. Both teams have high xG, and past meetings had over 3 goals.\n3. Brentford to score 2+ goals at 1.90. Their attack is strong, Ipswich's defense weak.\n4. Correct score Brentford 3-1 at 15.00. High-risk but plausible given their scoring form.\n\nPrediction: Brentford to win 3-1. Their attacking quality and Ipswich's defensive vulnerabilities make this likely.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the contrast between relegated Ipswich and Brentford's European push. Mention the thriller reverse fixture, key players, and the stakes for Brentford. Use vivid language to set the scene.\n\nNeed to cite sources properly. Use the search results for xG stats, H2H, team news, etc. Check all facts against the provided data. Make sure odds are accurately represented in decimal format. Avoid any markdown and ensure JSON structure is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Ipswich Town, already relegated with the league's worst home record (4W-13L), host Brentford who sit 9th and eye a top-half finish.
