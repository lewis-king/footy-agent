    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Bournemouth vs. Man Utd. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results. The user emphasized using up-to-date facts, so I'll focus on the sources given.\n\nStarting with the match overview. Bournemouth is 8th with 49 points, Man Utd 14th with 38. Both have struggled recently, each losing 50% of their last six matches. The head-to-head record shows Bournemouth has 4 wins in 15 meetings, but they won 3-0 earlier this season. That's from sources [2] and [3]. The predicted lineups are provided, so I should note any key players and their roles.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -0.75 with Bournemouth at 1.91. According to source [6], Bournemouth is a -0.5 home favorite, but the user specified -0.75. I need to reconcile this. The xG stats from [1] and [7] show Bournemouth's xG is higher, and they have a better home form. Man Utd's away form is poor. The recommendation here should lean towards Bournemouth covering the handicap, citing their xG advantage and home performance.\n\nKey player matchups: Semenyo vs. Maguire. Semenyo is Bournemouth's top scorer, and Maguire's defensive stats might be a weakness. Fernandes vs. Cook in midfield. Fernandes creates chances, but Cook's defensive stats could neutralize him. These insights come from [3] and [5].\n\nTeam news: The user provided predicted lineups, but I should check for injuries. Source [5] mentions Man Utd's De Ligt is injured, but the predicted lineup doesn't include him. No other injuries are noted in the sources, so I'll stick with the given lineups.\n\nBetting insights: Value on Bournemouth's Asian Handicap based on xG and home form. Over 2.5 goals since their past meetings have high scores (source [2] and [3]). Both teams to score, as both have defensive issues (sources [1], [2], [7]).\n\nPrediction: Bournemouth 2-1. Their home advantage and recent H2H performance support this. Confidence at 7/10 due to Man Utd's inconsistency.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the contrast between Bournemouth's rise and Man Utd's struggles. Use the 3-0 previous win as a talking point. Emphasize the tactical battle and key players.\n\nCitations: Need to map each fact to the correct source index. For example, H2H stats from [3], form from [2], xG from [1] and [7], etc. Make sure every claim is backed by a source.\n\nAlso, ensure all odds are in decimal format and the Asian Handicap line is correctly stated as -0.75. Avoid using any external knowledge, only the provided sources. Check for any discrepancies in the data, like conflicting form stats, but the sources seem consistent.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Bournemouth (8th, 49pts) host Manchester United (14th, 38pts) in a Premier League clash between teams seeking momentum.
