    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Fulham vs Everton. First, I need to gather all the relevant data from the provided search results. Starting with the match overview, Fulham's recent form is mixed with 4 wins and 6 losses in their last 10 games. They have a goal differential of -2, which isn't great, but they did beat teams like Liverpool and Tottenham. Everton, on the other hand, has only 1 win in their last 10 and a lot of draws. Their xPTS is low, ranking 16th and 15th in recent form according to source [2]. \n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, Fulham is at -0.5 with 1.93 odds. The models from sources [3] and [7] give Fulham around a 48-49% chance to win, which translates to implied odds of about 2.08. Since the bookmaker offers 1.93, there's a slight value here. Everton's away form is poor, and their xGA is higher than Fulham's xG, so Fulham might cover the handicap.\n\nKey player matchups: Looking at the predicted lineups, Berge vs Garner in midfield could be crucial. Berge's defensive stats are solid, and if he can disrupt Garner, Everton's creativity might suffer. Also, Jim\u00e9nez against Branthwaite. Jim\u00e9nez has a high xG, and Branthwaite's recent form is shaky, so that's a matchup to watch.\n\nTeam news: From source [10], Fulham has several injuries\u2014Reed, Castagne, Lukic, Nelson, Muniz. Everton is missing Tarkowski, Doucour\u00e9 is doubtful. Both teams have key players out, which might affect their performance.\n\nBetting insights: The Asian Handicap value on Fulham, Under 2.5 goals (53% chance per [3]), and Both Teams to Score No (49.6% chance). The odds for Under 2.5 are -128, which is about 1.78, but the model suggests a 53% probability, so maybe a slight edge there. BTTS No at 1.90 odds vs 49.6% implied probability (around 2.02) so maybe not great value. Need to check the actual odds offered.\n\nPrediction: Fulham 2-1. Their home advantage and Everton's defensive issues. Confidence 7/10 because Everton's draws might sneak a point, but Fulham's recent wins against stronger teams suggest they can edge it.\n\nMy Say: Need to highlight the stakes for Fulham's European hopes and Everton's struggle. Mention the key injuries and how they might influence the game. Maybe touch on the tactical aspects from the midfield battle.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Fulham host Everton at Craven Cottage in a mid-table Premier League clash with contrasting motivations.
