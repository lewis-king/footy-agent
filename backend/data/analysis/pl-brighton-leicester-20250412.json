Brighton's recent form shows mixed results (W1 D1 L3 last five) but they've dominated this fixture historically (unbeaten in six H2Hs)[1][7]. Leicester's defensive frailties (2.15 GA/game) and goal drought (no goals in eight matches) make them prime candidates for another defeat[2][4]. The match presents a classic contrast - Brighton's structured build-up against Leicester's desperate survival bid[3][4].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Brighton vs Leicester Premier League match on April 12, 2025. They specifically mentioned using live-sourced information and following a strict JSON structure. Let me start by reviewing the search results provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results, I see that Brighton is in better form, with sources mentioning they're unbeaten in their last six games against Leicester [1][2][7]. Leicester, on the other hand, has eight consecutive losses and struggles to score [2][4]. That's a key point for the match overview.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap line is -1.5 for Brighton. The odds are 1.85 for them to cover that. Sources like [1] and [4] suggest Brighton could cover the -1.75 or -1.5 handicap. However, I need to check the implied probability. The user mentioned value bets where the bookmaker's implied probability is lower than the model's. For example, if the book gives 1.85 (54.05% implied), but the model predicts 60%, that's value. According to [5], Dimers' model gives Brighton a 68.5% chance to win, which translates to odds around 1.46. The book's 1.85 is higher, indicating value. So the Asian Handicap analysis should highlight this discrepancy.\n\nKey player matchups: Leicester's defense is weak, so Brighton's attackers like Joao Pedro and Welbeck might exploit that. Leicester's Vardy isn't performing well [4], so Dunk and Baleba could dominate. Buonanotte vs Hinshelwood might be a key wing battle [3][4].\n\nTeam news: The predicted lineups are given, so I'll structure them as per the user's instructions. Injuries and suspensions are mentioned in [2] and [4], but the search results don't provide specific current injuries. Wait, in the prompt's team lineups, are there any injuries implied? The user provided predicted lineups, but in the search results, [2] mentions Brighton has injury issues but doesn't list names. Since the user said to use the predicted lineups given, maybe there are no major injuries beyond that. So I'll note that both teams have key players available as per the lineups.\n\nBetting insights: Over 2.5 goals is supported by [3] and [5], with Leicester's defensive issues. Both teams to score 'No' makes sense given Leicester's scoring drought [2][4]. Brighton -1.5 AH is a strong recommendation. Also, corners under 10.5 from [1] and [3].\n\nPrediction: Brighton to win 2-0, as suggested in [2] and [7]. Confidence level around 7/10 because Leicester is struggling but might put up a fight.\n\nMy Say: Need to craft an engaging narrative, maybe contrasting Brighton's European aspirations with Leicester's relegation battle. Highlight the tactical aspects and key players.\n\nI need to ensure all citations are correctly referenced from the search results. Also, check that the JSON structure follows exactly what's specified, with the right keys and nested objects. Avoid any markdown and stick to the format. Make sure the Asian Handicap analysis table uses the correct headers and rows as per the example. Double-check the odds and probabilities for accuracy. Finally, ensure that the 'my_say' section is lively and unique, not just a rehash of the analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Brighton host Leicester in a crucial Premier League clash at the Amex Stadium, with the Seagulls pushing for European qualification while Leicester languish in 19th place amidst an eight-game losing streak[2][4].
