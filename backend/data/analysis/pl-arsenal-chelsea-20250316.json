    "match_overview": "This London derby pits second-place Arsenal (50 points) against fourth-place Chelsea (54 points) in a crucial Premier League clash. Arsenal enter with mixed league form (WWDDL last 5) but fresh off a 9-3 aggregate Champions League victory over PSV [9]. Chelsea arrive on a 4-game winning streak across competitions, though their last league outing saw a concerning 2-0 defeat to Ipswich [14]. Historically, Arsenal are unbeaten in their last six Premier League meetings with Chelsea (W3 D3) [8][9]. The Gunners boast the league's second-best attack (49 goals) while Chelsea have conceded 36 goals - fourth-worst among top-half teams [10][11]. Recent xG data shows Arsenal outperforming Chelsea in expected goals (3.29 vs 1.37 in April 2024 meeting) [2], though Chelsea's attack has improved since acquiring Neto and Sancho [4][6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Arsenal vs. Chelsea match. Let me start by reviewing the user's query and the provided search results to gather all necessary information. \n\nFirst, the user wants a JSON structured analysis with specific sections. The query mentions using up-to-date facts sourced from the provided search results, so I can't rely on my own knowledge. Let's check each section required.\n\n**Match Overview**: I need to summarize the teams' forms, recent performances, and context. From the search results, Arsenal is second in the league with 50 points [10], while Chelsea is fourth [4][9]. Arsenal's recent form includes a Champions League win over PSV but draws in the Premier League [5][9]. Chelsea has three consecutive wins but a recent loss to Ipswich [14]. Their head-to-head record shows Arsenal unbeaten in six league games against Chelsea [9]. \n\n**Asian Handicap Analysis**: The line is -0.5 for Arsenal. I need to analyze this using the teams' forms and stats. Search results indicate Arsenal's attacking strength (49 goals) [10] and Chelsea's defensive issues (36 goals conceded) [11]. The Asian Handicap odds are 1.88 for Arsenal and 2.11 for Chelsea. The analysis should consider recent form and xG stats, which show Arsenal's higher xG in past matches [2][7]. \n\n**Key Player Matchups**: The user provided predicted lineups. Key players to compare include Martin \u00d8degaard vs. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, Gabriel Martinelli vs. Reece James, and Cole Palmer vs. Declan Rice. From search results, \u00d8degaard is crucial for Arsenal's creativity [5], while Palmer is a key creator for Chelsea [4][6]. Martinelli's pace against James' defensive skills could be a critical duel [5][12].\n\n**Team News**: Use the predicted lineups from the query. Injuries and suspensions are mentioned in the search results. For Arsenal, Bukayo Saka is injured [12], and Tomiyasu, Havertz, Jesus are out [5]. Chelsea's injuries include Nicolas Jackson, Noni Madueke, and others [4][5]. Suspensions: Mykhailo Mudryk is suspended for Chelsea [5]. \n\n**Betting Insights**: Look for value bets. The user mentioned Over 2.5 goals [6], Both Teams to Score [6], and Arsenal's Asian Handicap. Also, correct score markets like 3-1 Arsenal [1]. Recent meetings have high goals [6], and both teams' attacking stats support BTTS [6]. \n\n**Prediction**: Score prediction considering Arsenal's home advantage and Chelsea's defensive issues. Previous xG data [2][7] and recent form suggest a 2-1 Arsenal win. \n\n**My Say**: A journalist conclusion. Highlight the London derby's excitement, key players, and tactical aspects. Mention the stakes for both teams in the league race [9][12].\n\nI need to ensure all facts are sourced from the provided results. Check each citation to make sure they're correctly referenced. For example, Arsenal's league position is from [10], Chelsea's from [4][9]. Injuries from [5][12]. Head-to-head stats from [8][9]. xG data from [2][7]. \n\nAlso, the user emphasized using decimal odds and avoiding American terms. The Asian Handicap line needs to be correct (-0.5) as per the query. Check each section for compliance with the JSON structure and ensure all fields are populated accurately. Make sure to include the citations in the <think> section with URLs and descriptions. Finally, verify that the JSON is valid and adheres to the schema provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This London derby pits second-place Arsenal (50 points) against fourth-place Chelsea (54 points) in a crucial Premier League clash.
