    "match_overview": "Arsenal and PSG clash in a highly anticipated Champions League semi-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners enter this match unbeaten in 12 games across all competitions, having dismantled Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals[1][3]. PSG arrive as newly crowned Ligue 1 champions but suffered a 2-0 defeat at this venue in October and come off a weekend loss to Nice[1][3]. This matchup features contrasting styles - Arsenal's disciplined defensive structure (conceding just 0.6 goals per UCL home game[5]) against PSG's explosive attack led by Ousmane Dembele (4.8 shots per UCL match[7]) and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia[2][3].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Arsenal vs. PSG Champions League semi-final. Let's start by going through the user's query and the provided search results to gather all necessary information.\n\nFirst, the user wants a structured JSON output with specific sections like match overview, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, team news, betting insights, prediction, and a journalist-style conclusion. They emphasize using live-sourced data, so I must rely on the given search results and not my own knowledge.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see multiple sources discussing the match. Result [1] mentions Arsenal's strong form, PSG's recent loss to Nice, and key injuries. The predicted lineups are provided in the user's query, so I should use those. Result [3] gives insights into PSG's improved squad compared to their last match against Arsenal, noting the inclusion of Dembele and Kvaratskhelia. Result [5] has head-to-head stats showing Arsenal's dominance. Result [7] discusses betting odds and specific player stats like Dembele's shots and Mendes' likelihood of getting carded.\n\nFor the match overview, I'll highlight Arsenal's unbeaten run and PSG's recent form, referencing their aggregate win over Liverpool and loss to Nice. I'll cite the sources that mention these points. The Asian handicap analysis needs to compare the teams' forms, home/away performance, and H2H. The line is -0.25 for Arsenal, so I'll check if the odds provided (1.87 vs. 2.05) offer value based on the stats. Since Arsenal has a strong home record and PSG's defensive issues, recommending Arsenal on the Asian handicap makes sense.\n\nKey player matchups should focus on Saka vs. Mendes and Dembele vs. Kiwior. Using the search results, I can note Mendes' disciplinary record and Saka's effectiveness. Dembele's shot stats from [7] and Kiwior's inexperience from [1] and [6] are relevant.\n\nTeam news requires listing injuries and suspensions. From [1], Arsenal has several key players out, while PSG has none. The predicted lineups are given, so I'll structure them as per the user's instructions.\n\nBetting insights should include value opportunities. The BTTS Yes from [4] and [5] is supported by both teams' scoring stats. Over 2.5 goals is another option, considering Arsenal's UCL games and PSG's attack. Dembele's shots and Mendes' card potential from [7] are good for prop bets.\n\nPrediction needs a score and reasoning. Arsenal's home advantage and PSG's defensive vulnerabilities suggest a 2-1 win. The journalist conclusion should tie everything together, emphasizing the tactical battle and key players.\n\nI need to ensure all facts are cited correctly using the provided search result indices. Also, follow the JSON structure precisely, avoiding markdown and using the correct decimal odds. Double-check the Asian handicap line and odds to avoid mistakes. Make sure to use European terminology and decimal odds throughout.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Arsenal and PSG clash in a highly anticipated Champions League semi-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium.
