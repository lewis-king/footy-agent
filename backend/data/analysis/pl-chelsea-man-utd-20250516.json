    "match_overview": "Friday's Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge pits fifth-placed Chelsea against 16th-placed Manchester United in a fixture with starkly contrasting motivations. Chelsea (W3-D1-L1 last 5 PL games) remain locked in a battle for Champions League qualification, needing victories in their final two matches to secure a top-five finish[4][12]. Their recent 3-1 demolition of Liverpool (2.92 xG) showcased attacking potency, though last week's 2-0 defeat at Newcastle came amid controversial red card decisions[1][12]. Manchester United arrive winless in seven league matches (D1-L6), having scored just four goals in that span while conceding 11 in their last four away games[12][14]. Ruben Amorim's side appears focused on their upcoming Europa League final, with league performances characterized by defensive disorganization (-0.93 xG difference during mid-season slump)[3][14]. Historically, this fixture has produced more draws (27) than any other in Premier League history, though Chelsea's 4-3 thriller here last season suggests potential for fireworks[4][10].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Chelsea vs. Man Utd. First, I need to gather all the relevant data from the provided search results. Let's start with the match overview.\n\nChelsea's form: The search results mention Chelsea's recent xG stats. From [1], Chelsea's last five games show varying xG, including a high of 2.92 against Liverpool. They've had some wins, like 3-1 against Liverpool, but also a draw against Ipswich. However, [2] indicates a slump earlier in the year, but recent form seems better with wins over Everton and Liverpool. They lost to Newcastle recently but had a red card, which might have affected the result.\n\nMan Utd's form: [3] talks about Man Utd's xG under Amorim. They had a bad run but improved defensively recently. However, their league position is 15th, and they're winless in seven Premier League games. [14] shows their recent match against Brentford was a 4-3 loss, and they've been inconsistent.\n\nHead-to-head: [4] mentions this is the most drawn fixture in Premier League history. The reverse fixture was 1-1. [10] notes Chelsea's recent home advantage, winning the last home game against United 4-3.\n\nTeam news: For Chelsea, [11] and [13] mention injuries to Nkunku, Fofana, Guiu, and suspensions for Jackson and Mudryk. The predicted lineup from [9] and [12] includes Sanchez, Colwill, Palmer, etc. For United, [10] and [12] mention possible rotations due to the Europa League final. Injuries include Shaw, Mount, and others, but the predicted lineup has Onana, Yoro, Fernandes, etc.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -1.0 for Chelsea at 1.9. Chelsea's home form is strong, with five wins in six at Stamford Bridge. United's away form is poor, no wins since March. The Opta supercomputer in [4] gives Chelsea a 65.4% chance to win. Dimers' model in [7] predicts 62.8% chance for Chelsea. Comparing implied probability (1.9 odds = ~52.6%) vs. model's ~63%, there's value in Chelsea -1.0.\n\nKey player matchups: Cole Palmer is crucial for Chelsea, with four goals against United [4]. He'll likely face United's defense, possibly Yoro and Lindelof. Fernandes vs. Caicedo in midfield could be key, as Fernandes creates chances but Caicedo disrupts play.\n\nBetting insights: Chelsea to cover -1.0 handicap, Both Teams to Score (United's recent games have BTTS 60% [14], Chelsea's defense at home is solid but United might get a consolation), and Cole Palmer over 2.5 shots (he averages 3.53 per 90 [16]).\n\nPrediction: Chelsea 3-1, covering the handicap. Their motivation for UCL spot, home form, and United's focus on Europa final.\n\nMy Say: Need to highlight the contrast in motivations, Chelsea's resurgence, United's distractions, and key players like Palmer. Make it engaging with some flair.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Friday's Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge pits fifth-placed Chelsea against 16th-placed Manchester United in a fixture with starkly contrasting motivations.
