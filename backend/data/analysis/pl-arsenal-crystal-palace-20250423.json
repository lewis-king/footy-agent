Arsenal's 5-1 demolition of Palace in December 2024 [3] sets the tone, though both teams face key absences. Mikel Arteta's side boasts a 71.2% win probability per simulations [4], fueled by a league-high 3.25 xG in their last H2H meeting [1]. Palace's survival hinges on Jean-Philippe Mateta's 13-goal threat [3], but their 0.42 xG in December's defeat reveals underlying vulnerabilities [1].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Arsenal vs Crystal Palace match. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results and structure it according to the required JSON format.\n\nStarting with the match overview. Arsenal is in 2nd place, chasing the title, while Palace is 12th. The previous meeting was a 5-1 win for Arsenal. Recent form: Arsenal has 3 wins, 2 draws in last 5; Palace has mixed results. Key stats from search results: Arsenal's xG is 3.25 vs Palace's 0.42 in their last meeting [1]. H2H record shows Arsenal dominates with 15 wins in 24 matches [2]. \n\nFor team news, the predicted lineups are given. Injuries: Arsenal's Havertz and Jesus out [3], Palace's Doucour\u00e9 injured [3]. Need to structure this into the team_news section with citations. \n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -1.25 for Arsenal. Looking at their recent xG stats, Arsenal's xG is significantly higher, and they have a strong home form. The predicted score from source [4] is 2-0, which would cover the -1.25 handicap. Odds of 1.98 for Arsenal -1.25 might offer value if the model's probability is higher than the implied 50.5% (1/1.98). \n\nKey player matchups: Saka vs Mitchell. Saka's attacking stats vs Mitchell's defensive duties. Also, Odegaard vs Wharton in midfield. Use stats from [6] where Saka's contributions are highlighted. \n\nBetting insights: Over 2.5 goals based on Arsenal's high xG and Palace's defensive issues. Arsenal to win both halves, and Mateta to score anytime given his 13 goals [3]. Need to check if the odds provided in the search results support these. Source [4] mentions over 2.5 goals at 1.9, which is a good value if the model suggests higher probability. \n\nPrediction: 3-1 Arsenal with confidence 8/10. Reasoning based on attacking strength and Palace's defensive vulnerabilities. \n\nMy_say: Need a engaging narrative, maybe highlighting the title chase for Arsenal and Palace's fight for mid-table. Use vivid language and tie in key players like Saka and Mateta.\n\nCitations are crucial. Each fact needs to reference the correct source. For example, xG stats from [1], H2H from [2], injuries from [3], predicted score from [4], player stats from [6].\n\nFinally, ensure all sections are filled accurately, following the JSON structure, and adhering to the guidelines. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and maintain a professional tone. Double-check the odds and ensure they're in decimal format. Make sure the Asian Handicap analysis correctly interprets the -1.25 line and the value assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Arsenal host Crystal Palace in a crucial Premier League clash at Emirates Stadium, with the Gunners (2nd) pushing for the title and Palace (12th) seeking mid-table stability.
