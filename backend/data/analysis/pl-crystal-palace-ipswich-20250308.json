Palace (12th) have transformed from relegation candidates to European hopefuls under Oliver Glasner, winning 7 of their last 15 league matches while averaging 2.1 goals/game during this resurgence [1][5]. Ipswich (19th) remain winless in 9 league games, possessing the division's third-worst defensive record (1.8 goals conceded/game) [1][3]. This 22nd competitive meeting sees Palace holding historical dominance (13 wins vs Ipswich's 8) with 65% of goals coming in second halves [3][8].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Crystal Palace vs Ipswich Premier League match on March 8, 2025. Let me start by going through the search results provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the team news. Crystal Palace has some key injuries. Jean-Philippe Mateta is out with a head injury, and Will Hughes is suspended. They also have long-term injuries like Chadi Riad and Cheick Doucoure. Their probable lineup is a 3-4-2-1 with Nketiah replacing Mateta.\n\nFor Ipswich, defensive injuries are a problem. Cameron Burgess, Axel Tuanzebe, and Christian Walton are out. Kalvin Phillips is a maybe, and they have several attackers missing. Their lineup might struggle defensively.\n\nHead-to-head stats from [3] and [8] show Palace has a better record, with 13 wins to Ipswich's 8. Recent form from [1] and [5] indicates Palace is on a three-game winning streak, while Ipswich hasn't won a league game since December.\n\nThe Asian handicap analysis is tricky. The line is 0 with both teams at 1.90. But Palace is at home and in better form. However, some sources like [4] suggest Ipswich might have value. But considering Palace's recent form and home advantage, maybe Palace is the safer bet.\n\nKey player matchups: Palace's Eze and Sarr against Ipswich's weakened defense. Also, Nketiah stepping in for Mateta could be crucial. For Ipswich, Jack Clarke is a key attacker, but their defense is depleted.\n\nBetting insights: Over 2.5 goals seems likely based on Palace's scoring trends [5][6]. Both teams to score is also possible as Palace's defense isn't airtight.\n\nFinal score prediction: Palace 2-1 Ipswich with moderate confidence, around 7/10. That aligns with [5] and [7], where Chris Sutton predicted 1-0 but some others suggest higher scores.\n\nI need to structure all this into the required JSON format, making sure each section is filled with data from the sources. Also, validate the stats and ensure all 'raw' fields have detailed insights. Check for injuries, suspensions, and how they impact each team's performance. Make sure the Asian handicap analysis considers form, H2H, and team news.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Crystal Palace host Ipswich Town at Selhurst Park in a Premier League clash with contrasting stakes.
