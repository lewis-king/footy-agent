    "match_overview": "Brentford enter this Premier League clash on a four-game unbeaten run, including a crucial 2-0 away win at Nottingham Forest that keeps their European Conference League hopes alive[1][6]. Their attack has been revitalized with Bryan Mbeumo (18 PL goals) and Yoane Wissa forming a potent partnership, combining for 3 goals and 2 assists in their last home game[7][13]. Manchester United arrive after a stunning 3-0 Europa League semi-final first-leg win at Athletic Bilbao, though their domestic form remains concerning with just one win in seven league matches[5][8].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Brentford vs. Man Utd match. Let's start by breaking down the user's query and the provided search results. The user wants a structured JSON report focusing on value betting opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market. They emphasized using live-sourced data, so I must rely on the given search results and not my own knowledge.\n\nFirst, the match overview. From the search results, I see that Man Utd is coming off a strong 3-0 Europa League win against Athletic Bilbao, which is a confidence boost. However, their Premier League form is poor, sitting 14th. Brentford is on a four-game unbeaten run, including a win against Forest, and is pushing for a Conference League spot. The context here is that Man Utd might rotate players due to the upcoming Europa League second leg, which affects their lineup and performance.\n\nNext, team news. The search results mention that Man Utd has several injuries: Dalot, Martinez, Zirkzee. Mazraoui and Dorgu are out. They might field a younger side with players like Fredricson and Amass. Brentford's lineup seems more stable, with key players like Mbeumo and Wissa in form. I need to structure this into the team_news section, citing the sources properly.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -0.75 with home odds 2.04 and away 1.91. The user provided a predicted lineup where Man Utd is using a weakened team. Brentford's recent home form is strong, while Man Utd's away form is shaky. The value here might be on Brentford covering the -0.75 handicap. I should reference the sources that mention Brentford's home performance and Man Utd's rotation.\n\nKey player matchups: Mbeumo vs. Fredricson. Mbeumo is Brentford's top scorer, and Fredricson is a young defender. This could be a mismatch. Also, Eriksen's creativity against Yarmolyuk's defensive work. These insights come from the predicted lineups and stats like Mbeumo's goals.\n\nBetting insights: The user wants 3-5 insights. From the search results, both teams to score is likely (Brentford's attacking form, Man Utd's defensive issues). Over 2.5 goals is another, as both teams have high-scoring games. Also, considering Brentford's Asian Handicap value. Odds from the sources mention Brentford at 1.70 moneyline, which translates to decimal odds. Need to check the provided odds in the search results and align them correctly.\n\nPrediction: Considering rotation and form, Brentford might win 2-1. Confidence around 7/10. The reasoning ties into their home advantage and Man Utd's focus on Europa.\n\nMy_say needs to be engaging. Highlight the contrast between Brentford's European push and Man Utd's turmoil. Use vivid language to set the scene at Gtech Community Stadium, maybe referencing their previous encounters.\n\nCitations are crucial. Every fact needs a source. For example, Man Utd's Europa League result is from source 5 and 8. Brentford's unbeaten run is from 1 and 6. Injuries from 2 and 3. Each statement should have the correct source indices in brackets.\n\nI need to ensure that all data points are from the provided search results. For example, the head-to-head stats from 13, form from 6 and 9. Also, avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON structure. Check that the Asian Handicap analysis uses the correct line and odds as provided in the fixture info.\n\nFinally, cross-verify all stats and ensure the JSON structure matches the required schema. Make sure the citations are correctly numbered and correspond to the sources listed. Double-check that team news uses the predicted lineups from the user's prompt and the injury info from the search results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Brentford enter this Premier League clash on a four-game unbeaten run, including a crucial 2-0 away win at Nottingham Forest that keeps their European Conference League hopes alive[1][6].
