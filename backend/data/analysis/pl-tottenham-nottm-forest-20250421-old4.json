    "match_overview": "Tottenham host Nottingham Forest in a Premier League clash with contrasting motivations. Spurs (16th) prioritize Europa League success after Thursday's quarter-final win, having won just 2 of their last 8 league matches [7][8]. Forest (6th) seek Champions League qualification, despite recent defensive lapses costing them 6 points in April [7][8]. Historically, Spurs dominate this fixture with 5 wins in 7 meetings [1], but Forest's 1-0 victory in December shows their growing capability [2]. Both teams average 2.72 goals per combined match this season, with 75% of Tottenham's home games seeing Over 2.5 goals [1][4].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this betting analysis for the Tottenham vs. Nottingham Forest match. Let me start by going through all the provided search results to gather the necessary information.\n\nFirst, the match overview. From source [2], Tottenham is 16th in the league, coming off a 4-2 loss to Wolves. Nottingham Forest is 6th, lost their last game 1-0 to Everton. Their head-to-head from [1] shows Tottenham has won 5 of the last 7 meetings. Recent form from [7] mentions Spurs' Europa League commitments and their defensive issues in the league. Also, Forest's defensive mix-up in the Everton game might be a point to note.\n\nFor team news, source [2] says Tottenham is missing Dragusin, and Heung-Min and Maddison are doubtful. The predicted lineups are given in the query, so I should use those. Source [7] mentions Spurs making 5-6 changes after Europa League, which might affect their lineup. Forest has Aina injured and Awoniyi doubtful, but Elanga is expected to start.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is +0.0 with Spurs at 1.98 and Forest at 1.92. From [4], the recommendation was Forest +0.25, but our line is different. Need to compare form. Spurs' home form from [1] shows they score a lot but concede. Forest's away form has them scoring 75% in second halves. The Asian Handicap table in the JSON needs to reflect form, H2H, etc. Using stats from [1], Spurs have 5 wins in 7 H2H, but current form is poor. Value might be on Forest here given Spurs' defensive issues.\n\nKey player matchups: Johnson vs. Moreno. Johnson's pace against Moreno's defensive skills. From [7], Johnson scored twice in a previous match. Gibbs-White vs. Bissouma in midfield. Gibbs-White's creativity against Bissouma's defensive work. Also, Solanke against Milenkovic and Murillo. Solanke's physicality vs. their aerial ability.\n\nBetting insights: BTTS Yes from [4] and [5] with odds around 1.54. Over 2.5 goals from [1] and [4], odds 1.71. Forest Double Chance at 2.65 from [5]. Also, looking at corners, Spurs have more, maybe over 9.5 as per [4].\n\nPrediction: Considering Spurs' defensive issues and Forest's form, a 2-1 win for Forest. Confidence 7/10 because of Spurs' inconsistency but Forest's better league position.\n\nMy Say: Need to highlight the clash between Spurs' European focus and Forest's top-six push. Mention the tactical battle, key players, and the stakes for both teams.\n\nCitations: Make sure to cite sources properly. For example, H2H stats from [1], team news from [2] and [7], form from [8], etc. Each fact needs a citation from the provided sources.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Tottenham host Nottingham Forest in a Premier League clash with contrasting motivations.
