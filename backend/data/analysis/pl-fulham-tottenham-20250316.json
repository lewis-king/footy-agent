    "match_overview": "This London derby pits 10th-placed Fulham against 13th-placed Tottenham at Craven Cottage, with both sides separated by just three points in the Premier League table. Fulham arrive following a disappointing 2-1 loss to Brighton despite taking an early lead, while Tottenham come off an impressive 3-1 Europa League victory over AZ Alkmaar. Historically, Spurs have dominated this fixture with four wins in their last five visits before Fulham's shock 3-0 victory here last March. Marco Silva's side have shown defensive vulnerabilities at home, conceding more goals at Craven Cottage than on their travels, while Ange Postecoglou's men boast the league's second-best attack with 55 goals scored [1][3][4]. Both teams enter this clash needing points for European qualification aspirations, setting up a tactical battle between Fulham's organized defense and Tottenham's free-flowing attack.",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Fulham vs Tottenham Premier League match on March 16, 2025. The key here is to follow the structured JSON format provided and incorporate all the necessary elements while using the search results for accurate, up-to-date information.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the match overview. I need to include team form, recent performances, and context. From the search results, Fulham is 10th, four points from European spots, and Tottenham is 13th. The last meeting was a 1-1 draw. Tottenham's recent form includes a 3-1 Europa League win over AZ Alkmaar [1][3]. Fulham lost 2-1 to Brighton last weekend [1]. I'll note Tottenham's high scoring but defensive issues and Fulham's mixed home form [1][4][6].\n\nNext is the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.5 with home odds 2.03 and away 1.96. Fulham's home form isn't strong, with five wins and four losses at home [1]. Tottenham has a strong scoring record (55 goals, second in PL) but inconsistent away form. The search results mention Tottenham's recent victories and their historical performance at Craven Cottage, except the last 3-0 loss [1][5]. The recommendation should lean towards Tottenham given their attacking form and Fulham's defensive issues, but the line is tricky. Maybe a value bet on Tottenham -0.5 [1][4][7].\n\nKey player matchups: Raul Jimenez vs Tottenham's defense. Jimenez has seven home goals [1][3]. Son Heung-Min and Solanke for Tottenham, with Odobert possibly starting after two goals midweek [3][5]. Also, Maddison's form is crucial [7].\n\nTeam news needs injuries and lineups. Fulham's Lukic is suspended, Traore doubtful, Tete, Wilson, Nelson injured [3]. Tottenham's Danso, Kulusevski, Richarlison, Dragusin out; Odobert, Reguilon, Werner back [3]. Use the provided lineups but adjust based on available players. For instance, Odobert might start over someone else given his recent performance [3].\n\nBetting insights: Match result odds from search results: Fulham 50% [4], Tottenham 58.8% [7]. Over 2.5 goals is likely (63% in [4], 19 Tottenham games over 2.5 [1]). Both teams to score at 65% [4]. Raul Jimenez anytime scorer at home [1][3]. Recommend Tottenham win, over 2.5 goals, BTTS, Jimenez scorer [1][4][7].\n\nPrediction: Considering recent form and injuries, a 2-1 Tottenham win seems plausible [1][7]. Confidence around 7/10 due to Spurs' inconsistency but attacking strength.\n\nMy_say: Need a journalistic angle. Highlight the London derby aspect, Fulham's home struggles vs Tottenham's attack. Mention key players and recent performances. Maybe touch on Postecoglou's tactics and Silva's challenges. Make it engaging with some flair, like calling it a \"clash of contrasting philosophies\" [3][5].\n\nCitations: Ensure each fact is backed by the search results. For example, Fulham's xG stats from [2], team news from [3], head-to-head from [1][5], Tottenham's scoring from [1][4]. Need to map each citation number correctly and list all sources in the citations section.\n\nDouble-check the Asian Handicap line to avoid mistakes. The user emphasized getting the line right. The line here is -0.5 for home, so Tottenham as away would be +0.5. But since the line is -0.5 for Fulham, the analysis must clarify that backing Tottenham means they need to win outright. The odds are close, so value might be on Tottenham given their form and Fulham's defensive issues at home [1][4][7].\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON structure is exact, no markdown, proper escaping, and all fields are filled as per the schema. Use the 'raw' fields for additional insights, like xG data and historical stats. Make sure the citations in the text match the sources listed, using the correct numbers from the search results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This London derby pits 10th-placed Fulham against 13th-placed Tottenham at Craven Cottage, with both sides separated by just three points in the Premier League table.
