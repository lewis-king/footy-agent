    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs. Tottenham Premier League match. Let me start by going through the search results to gather the necessary information.\n\nFirst, the match overview. From the sources, Chelsea is in the top-four race and needs to win. They've been inconsistent lately but have key players returning. Tottenham's form is poor, sitting lower in the table. The head-to-head record shows Chelsea's dominance, especially at Stamford Bridge. The predicted lineups are given, which I should note in team news. Recent form from source [5] shows Chelsea's recent results as L, L, W, W, L, while Tottenham's are L, W, D, L, L. That's inconsistent for both, but Chelsea has home advantage.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -1.0 for Chelsea, which means they need to win by two goals for the bet to win. The odds are around 2.06. The predictive models from sources [2] and [3] give Chelsea a 61% chance to win. Comparing that to the implied probability of the odds (1/2.06 \u2248 48.5%), that's a value opportunity. Historical H2H from [8] shows Chelsea often scoring over 1.5 goals at home. But recent Chelsea form isn't stellar, so covering -1 might be tough. However, with returning attackers, maybe they can cover it. The recommendation would lean towards Chelsea -1.0 at 2.06 as value.\n\nKey player matchups: Cole Palmer vs. Tottenham's defense. Source [4] mentions Palmer's return and his 14 goals and 6 assists. Against a Spurs defense missing key players (source [7]), this could be a mismatch. Son Heung-Min against Chelsea's defense, which has been shaky (source [6] mentions Chelsea's xG conceded). Reece James vs. Son might be crucial, as James' attacking runs could pin Son back.\n\nTeam news: Chelsea has Palmer, Madueke, and Jackson back from injury (source [4][7]). Tottenham's lineup includes Romero and van de Ven, but their defense has been weak. Need to structure injuries/suspensions based on sources. Chelsea's injuries are cleared, while Tottenham might have defensive issues.\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Chelsea to win at 1.65 (source [2]) vs. 61% probability (implied 60.6%), slight value. \n2. Over 2.5 goals at 1.40 (source [2][6]). Stats show high xG in previous meetings (source [6]), and both teams' defensive issues. \n3. Chelsea -1.0 AH at 2.06 with 61% chance (value). \n4. Both teams to score: Yes at -220 (source [6]), but maybe check if it's better to find another source. Alternatively, Chelsea to score over 1.5 (source [8] mentions 16 of 17 home games they scored 2+).\n\nPrediction: Chelsea 3-2 (source [7]) but considering their recent 2-1 prediction [1], maybe 2-1. But with returning attackers, maybe higher score. Confidence around 7/10.\n\nMy say: Highlight the London derby intensity, Chelsea's UCL push, Spurs' defensive woes, and key player returns. Make it engaging with a narrative around Palmer's impact and Postecoglou's tactics.\n\nNeed to ensure all facts are sourced correctly. Check each section's citations. Make sure odds are in decimal format and correctly referenced. Avoid using any unsourced info. Also, structure the JSON correctly as per the schema provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This London derby carries significant weight for Chelsea's top-four ambitions against a Tottenham side languishing in 14th position.
