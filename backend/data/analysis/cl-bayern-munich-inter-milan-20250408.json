    "match_overview": "Bayern Munich hosts Inter Milan in a Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Allianz Arena, with both teams showcasing contrasting strengths. Bayern arrive with a formidable home record (83% win rate in last six UCL home games) [3] but face injury concerns including Manuel Neuer, Jamal Musiala, and Alphonso Davies [2][8]. Inter counter with Europe's best defense (8 clean sheets in 10 UCL matches) [5][6] and tactical flexibility under Simone Inzaghi. The Nerazzurri are unbeaten in 9 of their last 10 European matches [3] while Bayern haven't lost a UCL home game since 2021 [5]. This clash pits Harry Kane's record-breaking goalscoring (10 UCL goals) [2] against Inter's organized low block that's conceded just 0.2 xGA per UCL away game [6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Bayern Munich vs Inter Milan Champions League match. First, I need to make sure I follow all the user's guidelines and structure the JSON correctly. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis with up-to-date information from the provided search results. Let me start by going through each section step by step.\n\n**Match Overview:**  \nI need to summarize the key points from the search results. Bayern's home form is strong, with a 83% win rate in their last six CL home games [3]. They have injuries to key players like Neuer, Musiala, Davies, and Upamecano [2][8]. Inter's defense is solid, keeping 8 clean sheets in 10 CL matches [5][6]. Their xG of 12.3 in the group stage was higher than Bayern's [6]. Recent form: Bayern beat Augsburg 3-1 [2][5], while Inter drew 2-2 with Parma [4][8]. Head-to-head, Bayern has won 4 of 7 encounters [2][5]. \n\n**Asian Handicap Analysis:**  \nThe line is -0.5 with both teams at 1.95 odds. Bayern's home strength vs Inter's defense. Bayern's expected goals but Inter's low xGA. The value might be on Inter +0.5 because of their defensive record and Bayern's missing players. Need to reference the stats like clean sheets and Bayern's reliance on Kane [1][5][6].\n\n**Key Player Matchups:**  \nHarry Kane vs Inter's defense (Acerbi/Bastoni). Kane has 10 CL goals [2][5], but Inter's defense is tight. Thuram/Martinez against Bayern's makeshift defense (Dier/Kim). Inter's forwards could exploit Bayern's injuries at the back [4][7][8].\n\n**Team News:**  \nBayern's injuries: Neuer, Musiala, Davies, Upamecano, Coman, Ito [2][7][8]. Inter's lineup has Sommer, Pavard, Barella returning [4][8]. Use the predicted lineups provided in the query.\n\n**Betting Insights:**  \n1. Both Teams to Score: No. Inter's defense and Bayern's injuries. Odds around 1.80 [1][5][7].  \n2. Under 2.5 Goals. Both teams' defensive stats. Odds -110 [7].  \n3. Inter Double Chance. Draw or Inter at 1.83 [1][3].  \n4. Correct Score 1-1. Tight game, maybe low-scoring [3][5].  \n\n**Prediction:**  \n1-1 draw. Bayern's home edge vs Inter's defense. Confidence 6/10 because of possible low scoring.\n\n**My Say:**  \nHighlight the tactical battle, Kane's pursuit of the golden boot, Inter's treble ambitions, and the significance of the Allianz Arena hosting the final. Mention the historical context from 2010 final [2][5][6].\n\n**Citations:**  \nNeed to map each fact to the search result indices. For example, Bayern's injuries are in [2][7][8], Inter's clean sheets in [5][6]. Double-check each stat to ensure correct citations.\n\nNow, structure all this into the JSON format, ensuring all fields are covered with detailed analysis and proper citations. Make sure the <think> section lists all sources with URLs as per the guidelines.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Bayern Munich hosts Inter Milan in a Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Allianz Arena, with both teams showcasing contrasting strengths.
