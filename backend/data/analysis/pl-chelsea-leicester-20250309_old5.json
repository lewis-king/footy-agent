    "match_overview": "Chelsea host Leicester City in a crucial Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge, with the Blues seeking to solidify their top-four credentials against a Foxes side mired in relegation trouble. Enzo Maresca faces his former club amid stark contrasts in form - Chelsea have won 4 of their last 6 home league games while Leicester have lost 11 of their last 12 Premier League matches. The historical record favors Chelsea overwhelmingly, with 7 wins in the last 10 H2H meetings and four consecutive multi-goal victories [1][3][7]. This match presents Chelsea with an ideal opportunity to exploit Leicester's league-worst defensive record (47 goals conceded) and regain momentum in their Champions League qualification push [3][4][7].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Premier League match between Chelsea and Leicester on March 9, 2025. The response needs to be in a specific JSON format with various sections like team news, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, and so on. Plus, they want data-driven insights using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the search results to gather relevant information. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFrom search result [1], I see that Chelsea is hosting Leicester, and they have some team news. Filip Jorgensen is returning as goalkeeper, and Malo Gusto might play despite a knock. Romeo Lavia is back in training but might not start. Noni Madueke, Marc Guiu, and Nicolas Jackson are out. The predicted lineup for Chelsea is a 4-2-3-1 with Jorgensen in goal, Gusto, Tosin, Colwill, Cucurella in defense, Caicedo and Fernandez in midfield, Neto, Palmer, Sancho, and Nkunku upfront.\n\nSearch result [2] mentions Enzo Fernandez and Christopher Nkunku coming off the bench in a previous match, scoring. Nicolas Jackson, Noni Madueke, and Marc Guiu are still injured. Chelsea's predicted lineup here is similar, with Fofana possibly in defense. For Leicester, Woyo Coulibaly is fit, Caleb Okoli might start, and Stephy Mavididi could push for a start. Their lineup is a 4-2-3-1 with Hermansen, Justin, Faes, Okoli, Kristiansen, Ndidi, Soumare, Bounanotte, El Khannouss, Mavididi, and Vardy.\n\nResult [3] talks about Chelsea's dominance in H2H, winning 7 of the last 10. They recommend Chelsea -1.5 handicap. Leicester's poor form is noted, losing 11 of last 12. Prediction is 3-1 Chelsea.\n\nResult [4] suggests Chelsea -2 Asian handicap with a 3-0 correct score. They mention Leicester's defensive issues and Chelsea's strong home form.\n\nResult [5] from Dimers gives a 76.4% chance for Chelsea win, predicting 2-0. Their model is based on simulations.\n\nResult [6] has Chelsea's lineup with Jorgensen, Gusto, Fofana, Colwill, Cucurella, Fernandez, Caicedo, Sancho, Palmer, Nkunku, Neto. Mentions injuries to Badiashile, Lavia, Madueke, Guiu, Jackson.\n\nResult [7] from Forebet predicts 3-0 Chelsea, noting Chelsea's H2H dominance and Leicester's poor away form.\n\nResult [8] recommends Chelsea ML and over 3.5 goals, citing both teams' defensive vulnerabilities.\n\nNow, compiling all this info. Team news for Chelsea: Jorgensen returns, Gusto fit, Lavia back but cautious. Injuries: Madueke, Guiu, Jackson, Badiashile possibly. Leicester has Coulibaly fit, Okoli back, Ricardo Pereira still out. Suspensions? Mudryk is suspended for doping (from result [2]).\n\nFor lineups, Chelsea's projected XI seems consistent across sources: Jorgensen; Gusto, Tosin/Fofana/Colwill, Cucurella; Caicedo, Fernandez; Neto, Palmer, Sancho; Nkunku. Leicester: Hermansen; Justin, Faes, Okoli, Kristiansen; Ndidi, Soumare; Bounanotte, El Khannouss, Mavididi; Vardy.\n\nAsian handicap analysis: From results [3][4][5][7], Chelsea is expected to win by at least 2 goals. The handicap line here is -2, but the user provided Asian handicap line 0. Wait, the user's match details say Asian handicap line 0, but the search results mention -1.5 and -2. Maybe the user wants analysis based on the given line (0), but the sources suggest a stronger Chelsea. However, the JSON needs to follow their specified schema. Let's check the user's query again.\n\nWait, the user's query says \"Asian handicap line: 0\" but the search results discuss higher handicaps. However, in the JSON example, the Asian handicap analysis table has headers like Team, Form, Home/Away Form, etc. Need to structure that.\n\nFor key player matchups, Palmer vs Ndidi could be one, as Palmer is Chelsea's playmaker. Nkunku vs Faes, as Nkunku's movement against Leicester's shaky defense. Also, Vardy against Chelsea's center-backs, maybe Colwill.\n\nBetting insights: Match result Chelsea win, Over 3.5 goals (from result [8]). Asian handicap Chelsea -1.5 or -2. Correct score 3-0 or 3-1.\n\nFinal score prediction: 3-1 Chelsea with confidence level 7/10, as per multiple sources.\n\nCitations need to be mapped correctly. Each claim should have sources cited. For example, Chelsea's injuries are from [1][2][6], Leicester's lineup from [2], H2H from [3][7], etc.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON according to the schema. Must include all sections: match_overview, team_news (structured and raw), asian_handicap_analysis with table and recommendation, key_player_matchups, betting_insights, prediction, my_say, and citations.\n\nCitations need to list all sources used with URLs. From the search results, [1] to [8] are the sources, so each citation in the text should reference these numbers, and in the citations section, list each with URL and description.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea host Leicester City in a crucial Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge, with the Blues seeking to solidify their top-four credentials against a Foxes side mired in relegation trouble.
