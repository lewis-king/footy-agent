    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs Liverpool Premier League match on May 4, 2025. Let me start by going through all the search results and extracting relevant information.\n\nFirst, the match overview. From source [1], the win probabilities are Chelsea 39.7%, Liverpool 36.8%, draw 23.5%. The most likely score is 1-1. Source [5] mentions Liverpool's recent title win and Chelsea's push for top five. Also, Chelsea's form has improved with 17 points in the last eight matches. Head-to-head from [6] shows Liverpool's 10-game unbeaten streak against Chelsea. \n\nFor team news, source [3] lists Chelsea's injuries: Marc Guiu, Wesley Fofana, Mykhailo Mudryk (suspended), and doubts on Nkunku and Sanchez. Liverpool's Joe Gomez is out. The predicted lineups are given in the query, so I need to include those accurately.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -0.25 for Chelsea. From [1], Chelsea has a higher win probability. However, Liverpool's away form is strong (source [7] shows 2.02 xG away). The Asian Handicap table should compare form, home/away stats, H2H. Value might be on Liverpool +0.25 given their recent dominance in H2H and Chelsea's defensive issues (source [9] shows Chelsea concedes 1.18 goals per match).\n\nKey player matchups: Cole Palmer vs Trent Alexander-Arnold. Palmer's creativity vs Trent's defensive weaknesses. Also, Salah against Cucurella, considering Salah's record against Chelsea. Source [6] mentions Salah's impact in previous games.\n\nBetting insights: Over 2.5 goals seems likely given both teams' attacking stats (Chelsea 1.74 scored, Liverpool 2.35 scored per match [7][9]). Both teams to score yes, as both have high BTTS percentages. Liverpool +0.25 Asian Handicap at 2.02 odds offers value since the model gives them a 36.8% chance, which is higher than the implied probability of 49.5% (1/2.02).\n\nPrediction: 2-1 Liverpool. Confidence 7/10. Reasoning: Liverpool's attacking quality and Chelsea's defensive vulnerabilities. Recent form and H2H favor Liverpool.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the clash between Chelsea's European hopes and Liverpool's title celebration. Mention the tactical battles and key players. Create a narrative around Liverpool's consistency vs Chelsea's desperation.\n\nCitations: Need to reference all sources used. For example, win probabilities from [1], injuries from [3], xG stats from [7][9], H2H from [6], etc. Each fact must have a citation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea host newly-crowned champions Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in a clash contrasting motivations.
