    "match_overview": "This crucial Premier League clash sees mid-table rivals Everton (7-12-9) and West Ham (9-6-13) locked on 33 points at Goodison Park. The Toffees enter this match riding an eight-game unbeaten streak under David Moyes (W3 D5), though three consecutive draws have slightly stalled their momentum[5][6]. West Ham arrive with mixed form (W3 L3 in last six), fresh off a disappointing 1-0 loss to Newcastle[5][6]. Everton's defensive resilience (9 clean sheets, 1.25 GA/90) contrasts with West Ham's leaky backline (1.71 GA/90)[2][4]. Historically, Everton have dominated this fixture with 4-0 and 3-0 wins in their last two home meetings[6][8].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Everton vs West Ham. First, I need to go through all the search results provided and extract the relevant data. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market.\n\nStarting with the match overview. Everton's recent form is unbeaten in eight league games, including three draws. West Ham has mixed results with some key wins but recent losses. I need to mention their positions in the league, both on 33 points. From source [5], Everton's resilience under Moyes and West Ham's counter-attacking prowess are points to highlight. The Opta prediction from [6] gives Everton a slight edge, which supports the home advantage narrative.\n\nNext, team news. Source [3] mentions Everton's injury boosts with Broja returning to training, but he's unlikely to play. The predicted lineups are given in the query, but I should cross-check with [8] which lists injuries: Calvert-Lewin, McNeil, Ndiaye out. West Ham's lineup from the query seems to have a back three with Scarles and Wan-Bissaka as wingbacks. Need to confirm if any key players are missing for West Ham. The search results don't mention West Ham injuries beyond the lineup provided, so I'll stick with the given predicted lineups.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.25 with Everton at 1.88. From [1], Everton's Asian Handicap is -0.5 at +108, but the user's data says -0.25. Source [4] predicts Home -0.5 with 44% but the actual line here is -0.25, which is different. Everton's home form is strong, eight unbeaten, while West Ham's away form is shaky. The value here is on Everton since they're at home and have a better recent record. The odds of 1.88 for -0.25 offer good value because of their consistent form.\n\nKey player matchups. Beto vs Todibo/Kilman. Beto has been performing well as per [5]. Doucoure vs Alvarez in midfield. Doucoure's late runs could exploit Alvarez's defensive duties. Mykolenko vs Kudus/Bowen. Mykolenko's defensive stats need to be checked. Source [2] mentions Pickford's save percentage, which is 69.3%, which is better than Areola's 65.7% from [2]. That's a key point for the goalkeeper matchup.\n\nBetting insights. Both Teams to Score: No, because Everton has 32.1% clean sheets and West Ham 21.4% [2][4]. Correct score 2-1 Everton from [1] and [4] suggests under 2.5 but the user's predicted lineup might lean towards goals. Wait, source [4] predicts under 2.5 at 69%, but [1] mentions a 2-1 correct score. Need to reconcile. Maybe the BTTS No is more likely given both teams' defensive stats. But Everton's recent games have seen goals. Alternatively, over 2.5 at +130 from [1] could be a value bet if their form suggests higher scoring.\n\nPrediction: Everton to win 2-1. Confidence level around 7/10. Reasoning based on home form, defensive solidity, and West Ham's away struggles. The Opta model in [6] gives Everton a higher chance, aligning with this.\n\nMy Say: Need to craft an engaging narrative. Mention Moyes' impact, Broja's return as a subplot, and the tactical battle. Use vivid language to set the scene at Goodison Park.\n\nCitations: Each fact needs to be cited. For example, Everton's unbeaten run is from [5], Broja's return from [3], Pickford's stats from [2], etc. Make sure every data point has a source cited correctly in brackets.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This crucial Premier League clash sees mid-table rivals Everton (7-12-9) and West Ham (9-6-13) locked on 33 points at Goodison Park.
