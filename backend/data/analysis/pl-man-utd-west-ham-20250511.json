    "match_overview": "Manchester United host West Ham at Old Trafford in a crucial late-season Premier League clash. United enter this match 14th in the table (39 points) but boosted by their Europa League semi-final success, having scored 7 goals against Athletic Bilbao in their last two European matches[5][6]. West Ham sit 17th (37 points) with just 2 wins in their last 10 league matches[8][16]. Historically, United dominate the H2H (74 wins to West Ham's 49)[14], but the Hammers have won 3 of the last 4 meetings[6][14]. The Opta supercomputer gives United a 46.9% win probability vs West Ham's 28.3%[6].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Manchester United vs West Ham Premier League match. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results and structure it according to the user's requirements.\n\nStarting with the match overview. From the search results, I see that Manchester United is 14th in the Premier League with 39 points, while West Ham is 17th with 37 points. Recent form for United is mixed: they've won 3, drawn 1, and lost 2 of their last 6 matches. West Ham's form is worse, with only 2 wins, 4 draws, and 4 losses in their last 10 games. Head-to-head records show United has a historical advantage, but West Ham has won 3 of the last 4 meetings. The Opta supercomputer gives United a 46.9% chance to win, West Ham 28.3%, and a 24.8% chance for a draw. I'll cite sources [6] and [14] for these stats.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.5 for United at 1.92 odds. I need to compare this with the implied probability. The home team's odds of 1.92 imply a 52.08% chance (1/1.92), but Opta's model suggests 46.9%, which is lower. This means the bookmaker's odds might be overvaluing United slightly. However, considering United's recent Europa League success and home advantage, there might still be value. West Ham's poor away form (conceding 1.78 goals per game) supports a United win. Sources [6], [8], and [15] provide the necessary data on form and probabilities.\n\nKey player matchups: Bruno Fernandes vs Declan Rice. Fernandes has 19 goals and 5 assists this season, with high xGChain and xGBuildup. Rice's defensive stats include 2.1 tackles and 1.5 interceptions per game. Another matchup is Rasmus H\u00f8jlund against Konstantinos Mavropanos. H\u00f8jlund's xG of 4.21 and West Ham's defensive issues (58 goals conceded) suggest he could exploit their defense. Sources [3], [10], [11], [13], and [16] back these stats.\n\nTeam news: For Manchester United, injuries include Luke Shaw (muscle) and Victor Lindel\u00f6f (knock). West Ham has Nayef Aguerd (ankle) and Michail Antonio (hamstring) out. The predicted lineups are provided in the query, so I'll list them as given without adding new info. Sources [5], [7], and [8] mention these injuries.\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Manchester United to win at 2.10 odds. The Opta model's 46.9% chance vs the implied 47.6% (1/2.10) is close, but recent form and home advantage add value. Source [6].\n2. Over 2.5 goals at 1.85. Both teams have high xG (United 1.75, West Ham 1.31) and defensive issues. Source [15], [16].\n3. Bruno Fernandes to score anytime at 3.00. His 19 goals and high involvement make this valuable. Source [3], [11].\n\nPrediction: 2-1 to Manchester United. Their attacking form and West Ham's defensive struggles support this, despite United's defensive vulnerabilities. Confidence level 7/10. Sources [6], [8], [15].\n\nMy Say: Highlight the contrast between United's European success and league struggles, West Ham's desperation, key players, and the tactical battle. Use engaging language to set the scene. Sources [6], [14], [16].\n\nCitations need to be accurately mapped to each fact. Ensure all stats are correctly cited and the JSON structure is followed without markdown. Check for any inconsistencies in the data and verify against the sources provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Manchester United host West Ham at Old Trafford in a crucial late-season Premier League clash.
