    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to provide a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs Leicester Premier League match on March 9, 2025. Let's start by reviewing the search results to gather all necessary information.\n\nFirst, the match overview. Chelsea is in decent form, sitting in the top five, while Leicester is struggling near the relegation zone. The head-to-head record favors Chelsea, with seven wins in the last ten meetings. From source [2], Chelsea has been scoring at least two goals against Leicester consistently. Also, source [1] mentions Chelsea's prediction to win with a -2 Asian handicap, which implies confidence in a strong home performance.\n\nNext, team news. For Chelsea, source [3] and [5] note that Wesley Fofana and Beno\u00eet Badiashile are available, which is a boost. Injuries include Lavia, Madueke, Guiu, Jackson, and Kelliman. The projected lineup from [5] includes Jorgensen in goal, Gusto, Tosin, Colwill, Cucurella in defense, Caicedo and Fernandez in midfield, with Neto, Palmer, Sancho, and Nkunku up front. Leicester has injuries to Fatawu, Pereira, Stolarczyk, and Buonanotte is suspended [6]. Their lineup might include Hermansen, Justin, Faes, Vestergaard, Kristiansen in defense, with Winks, Ndidi, Soumare in midfield, and El Khannouss, Edouard, Mavididi attacking [6].\n\nAsian handicap analysis. The line is 0, but sources suggest Chelsea -1.5 or -2. Chelsea's home form is strong, with source [1] suggesting a -2 Asian handicap at -105 odds, and a 55-60% probability. However, the user's line is 0, so I'll adjust. Chelsea's recent form (WWDLW) vs Leicester's poor away form (LDWDL) and their defensive struggles (conceding six in last two away games [3]) make Chelsea heavy favorites. The Asian handicap 0 means backing Chelsea to win, which seems safe given the data.\n\nKey player matchups. Enzo Fernandez and Cole Palmer in midfield for Chelsea could dominate Leicester's weakened midfield. Leicester's defense, possibly Faes and Vestergaard, might struggle against Chelsea's attack, especially Nkunku and Sancho. Source [7] mentions Chelsea's midfield effectiveness.\n\nBetting insights. Match result: Chelsea win is likely. Over/under: Leicester's last four games had under 2.5 goals, but Chelsea's attack could push it over. Correct score predictions from [4] suggest 2-0 or 3-0. Corners: Chelsea averages 4.6 corners, Leicester concedes under 7.5, so under might be good [1].\n\nFinal score prediction. Most sources predict a Chelsea win, with [4] suggesting 2-0 as the most probable. Confidence level around 7/10 due to Chelsea's inconsistency but Leicester's poor form.\n\nCitations need to be tracked properly. Each piece of info must be linked to the correct source. For example, team news from [3], [5], [6], Asian handicap from [1], [2], [4], etc.\n\nNeed to structure the JSON exactly as specified, ensuring all sections are covered with detailed 'raw' fields. Citations in the analysis must use [1], [2], etc., and list all sources in the <think> section with URLs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea host relegation-threatened Leicester City at Stamford Bridge in a crucial Premier League clash.
