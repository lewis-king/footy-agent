    "match_overview": "This Premier League clash pits 9th-placed Brighton (51 points) against 3rd-placed Newcastle (62 points) in a critical late-season European qualification battle[1][4]. Brighton snapped a six-game winless streak with a dramatic 3-2 comeback against West Ham, showcasing their attacking potential despite defensive vulnerabilities[4][6]. Newcastle arrive with seven wins in eight matches, including a dominant 3-0 victory overwich Town, though their away form shows vulnerabilities with four losses in eight road games[3][4][8]. Historically, Brighton hold a slight edge at home with two wins and three draws in their last five Amex Stadium meetings[10].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Brighton vs. Newcastle Premier League match on May 4, 2025. They specified using live-sourced information and the provided search results. \n\nFirst, I need to structure the JSON response as per the given schema. Starting with the match overview, I should summarize both teams' recent form and context. Brighton is 9th with 51 points, coming off a 3-2 win against West Ham. Newcastle is 3rd with 62 points, winning six of their last seven. The search results mention their recent performances and European aspirations, so I'll include that.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is +0.25 for Brighton with 1.86 odds. From the search results, sources [3] and [8] suggest Brighton's potential to cover the handicap, especially since they've had success against Newcastle at home. Newcastle's form is strong, but Brighton's home record and recent comeback might offer value here. The recommendation would be Brighton +0.25, citing the higher odds and their ability to avoid defeat.\n\nKey player matchups: Mitoma vs. Trippier is crucial. Mitoma's speed against Trippier's experience. From source [4], Brighton's attack is varied, and Mitoma's role is key. Isak's form is highlighted in [15], so his duel with Dunk and van Hecke (back from injury per [4]) is another point. These matchups can influence the game's outcome.\n\nTeam news needs to be sourced from the provided lineups and injury reports. For Brighton, van Hecke is back ([4][11]), but Joao Pedro and others are out. Newcastle's Botman is back ([9][12]), but Joelinton and others are out. Using the predicted lineups given in the query, I'll structure the injuries and lineups accordingly.\n\nBetting insights: Over 3.5 goals is supported by both teams' recent high-scoring games ([6][8]). Newcastle's away win odds at 2.3 ([1]) might be undervalued given their form. Brighton's double chance at 1.57 ([1]) could offer value considering their home advantage. Each insight needs to reference the sources.\n\nPrediction: A 2-1 win for Newcastle. They're in better form, but Brighton's home strength might keep it close. Confidence level around 7/10, as per the close odds and recent H2H.\n\nMy_say should be engaging, highlighting the clash of styles, European stakes, and key players. Use vivid language to set the scene, maybe referencing the recent comeback by Brighton and Newcastle's Champions League push.\n\nCitations are crucial. Every fact needs a source index. For example, Brighton's win over West Ham is from [4], Newcastle's form from [4], xG stats from [2][7]. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered and matches the sources provided.\n\nI need to ensure all data points are from the search results, not prior knowledge. Check each stat against the sources. For example, the Asian Handicap recommendation in [3] and [8] supports Brighton +0.5, but the given line is +0.25. Adjust the analysis accordingly, noting the tighter line but still seeing value in Brighton's side.\n\nAlso, verify the odds mentioned in the sources. Source [1] lists Newcastle at 2.3, which aligns with their recommendation. The double chance odds from [1] at 1.57 for Brighton or draw. The over 3.5 goals is highlighted in [6] and [8], so that's solid.\n\nInjuries: Brighton's van Hecke is back ([4][11]), Newcastle's Botman returns ([9][12]). Joelinton out for Newcastle ([9][12][14]). Mention these with the correct source indices.\n\nFinally, compile all this into the JSON structure, ensuring each section follows the schema. Check for proper citations, correct odds, and alignment with the sources. Avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON format as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League clash pits 9th-placed Brighton (51 points) against 3rd-placed Newcastle (62 points) in a critical late-season European qualification battle[1][4].
