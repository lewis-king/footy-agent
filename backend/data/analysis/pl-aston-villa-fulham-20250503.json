Fulham (8th, 51pts) arrive buoyed by a comeback win at Southampton, displaying strong away attacking metrics with goals in 9/11 road trips[6]. Historical context favors Villa with 13 wins in 28 H2Hs[2], including 4 wins from last 5 meetings[3].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Aston Villa vs Fulham Premier League match on May 3, 2025. Let me start by going through the search results provided to gather the necessary information.\n\nFirst, looking at the match overview. The user mentioned that Aston Villa is at home, and Fulham is the away team. From the search results, I see that Aston Villa has a 55.4% chance of winning according to Stats Insider [1], and their recent form includes wins but also some losses, like the FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace [6]. Fulham, on the other hand, is coming off a win against Southampton [6]. The head-to-head record shows Aston Villa has won 13 out of 28 meetings, with Fulham winning 10 [2]. Recent H2H games have had BTTS and over 2.5 goals [6]. I should highlight Villa's strong home form but note their defensive issues, and Fulham's decent away attacking stats.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.75 for Villa with odds at 2.0. The user wants a focus on value. The Stats Insider model gives Villa a 55.4% chance, which translates to implied odds of around 1.8 (1/0.554 \u2248 1.8). The bookmaker's odds are 2.0, which is higher, indicating value. Fulham's odds at 1.93 for +0.75 might not be as valuable. I should compare the model's probabilities with the given odds to determine value. Also, recent H2H has Villa winning 4 of the last 5 [3], supporting the handicap.\n\nFor key player matchups, Ollie Watkins against Fulham's center-backs Andersen and Bassey. Watkins has been in good form, and Fulham's defense has conceded in most away games [6]. Another matchup could be in midfield between Kamara/Tielemans and Fulham's Berge/Lukic. Villa's midfield control could be crucial. Also, Fulham's wingers like Harry Wilson against Villa's full-backs, maybe Cash vs Wilson.\n\nTeam news: The predicted lineups are provided. I need to check if there are any injuries or suspensions mentioned. From the search results, Villa has Marcus Rashford injured [6], but he's on loan and not in the predicted lineup. Fulham has Robinson and Nelson sidelined [6]. So, structured injuries would list those. The projected lineups are given, so I can just structure that info.\n\nBetting insights: Look for value in the Asian Handicap, BTTS, and over 2.5 goals. The Stats Insider model suggests Villa has value at 2.0 odds. BTTS has occurred in Villa's last 3 home games and Fulham's away games [6][8]. Over 2.5 goals is supported by recent H2H and both teams' attacking stats [5][6][7]. Also, considering the odds for over 2.5 is -135 [12], which might still offer value if the model's probability is higher.\n\nPrediction: Based on the higher xG at home for Villa and their H2H dominance, a 2-1 win for Villa seems plausible. Confidence level around 7/10 because Fulham can score but Villa's home advantage and attacking form should edge it.\n\nMy Say: Need to craft an engaging narrative, maybe highlighting Villa's European aspirations vs Fulham's underdog status. Mention key players and recent drama, like the FA Cup exit, to add context.\n\nI need to ensure all facts are sourced from the provided search results and not from my own knowledge. Also, check that the Asian Handicap analysis correctly interprets the -0.75 line and the odds. Make sure to use decimal odds throughout and avoid American terms. Verify each betting insight's odds against the sources, like the over 2.5 goals odds from [12] and BTTS odds from [6].\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Aston Villa host Fulham at Villa Park in a crucial Premier League clash with European implications.
