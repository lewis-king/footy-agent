    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs Tottenham match. The user wants a structured JSON response with specific sections, so I need to make sure each part is covered accurately using the provided search results. \n\nFirst, the match overview. I should mention Chelsea's recent form and their position in the league, their home performance, and the context of the London derby. Tottenham's defensive struggles and their position lower in the table are important. Also, their previous encounter where Chelsea won 4-3, which is referenced in one of the search results [8]. Recent form from the sources: Chelsea has 50% wins in last 10 games, Tottenham 40% [2]. Their attacking stats from the xG data [3][10] show Chelsea's higher xG. \n\nNext, team news. The predicted lineups are provided, but I need to check the search results for injuries. Sources [4][7][9][13][14] mention Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, and Noni Madueke returning from injury for Chelsea. Romeo Lavia is injured again [14]. For Tottenham, possible lineup changes but no major injuries mentioned in the sources. So I structure the team news accordingly, citing the relevant sources.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis. The line is -1.0 for Chelsea. The sources [1][2] give Chelsea a 61.3% chance and 67% chance to win, which translates to odds around 1.62-1.69. The bookmaker's odds for -1.0 AH are 2.06, which implies around 48.5% probability. This discrepancy suggests value on Chelsea. The home team's strong home form (5 wins in last 7) and Spurs' defensive issues [5] support this. However, Chelsea's recent 1-0 loss to Arsenal [8] might indicate some caution, but with key players returning, the edge is there. So the recommendation would be Chelsea -1.0 AH.\n\nKey player matchups. Looking at the predicted lineups, Palmer vs Maddison. Palmer's return boosts Chelsea's attack, and Maddison's creativity for Spurs. Another matchup could be Chelsea's full-backs (James and Cucurella) against Spurs' wingers (Son and Johnson). Using xG stats from [3][10], Chelsea's higher xG in open play and set pieces could be factors here.\n\nBetting insights. Both Teams to Score: Yes, with odds of 1.61 (source [2] mentions 61% BTTS). Over 2.5 goals at 1.40 [1], supported by both teams' trends. Chelsea to win and Over 2.5 combo at 2.10. Correct score 3-1 to Chelsea from [2] at 12% probability. \n\nPrediction. Considering Chelsea's higher xG, home form, and returning players, a 3-1 scoreline makes sense. Confidence level based on the model's 61.3% chance [1], so confidence around 7/10.\n\nMy Say section should be engaging, highlighting the derby context, key returns, and tactical aspects. Mention the previous 4-3 thriller [8] to set the scene.\n\nCitations need to be correctly mapped from the search results. For example, team form stats from [2], xG data from [3][10], injury news from [4][7][14], etc. Need to ensure each fact is cited properly.\n\nI also need to check that all data points are from the provided sources and not prior knowledge. For example, using the 61.3% win probability from source [1], the 67% BTTS from [2], and the xG stats from [3][10]. \n\nDouble-checking the Asian Handicap calculation. The model's 61.3% win chance converts to odds around 1.63, while the AH -1.0 is at 2.06. That's a significant edge, so recommending Chelsea here makes sense. However, need to consider if covering the handicap is feasible. Chelsea's high xG (2.83 in previous match [3]) and Spurs' defensive issues (43 goals conceded [4]) support that. Also, recent head-to-head at Stamford Bridge with Chelsea scoring over 1.5 goals in 16 of 17 games [8] adds credibility.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Are there any key injuries or suspensions not mentioned? The search results mention Lavia out for Chelsea [14], but he's not in the predicted lineup. The lineups provided are predicted, so need to note that. Also, Spurs' defensive improvements? Not much in the sources, but they have conceded a lot [4][5].\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON structure is correct, with all required fields and proper citations in the <think> section. Each citation should have the URL and description from the search results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea (4th) host Tottenham (14th) in a crucial London derby with top-four implications.
