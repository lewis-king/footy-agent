    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for the Inter Milan vs Barcelona Champions League match. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results and structure it according to the user's requirements.\n\nStarting with the match overview, I should highlight the context of the semifinal second leg after the 3-3 draw in the first leg. Both teams are in tight title races domestically, but they rotated players over the weekend, indicating their focus on the Champions League. Recent form: Inter's 1-0 win over Verona and Barcelona's 2-1 victory against Real Valladolid. Head-to-head stats from the first leg and historical performance in Italy for Barca are important here.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is +0.25 for Inter with odds 1.88, and -0.25 for Barcelona at 2.06. Need to compare this with the Opta supercomputer's prediction of a 42.7% chance for Barca to win, which translates to implied odds around 2.34. Since the bookmaker offers 2.06, there's a slight value on Barcelona. However, considering Inter's strong home record and Barca's historical struggles in Italy, maybe the value isn't as clear. Also, Inter's xG efficiency in the first leg despite fewer shots could indicate they can handle Barca's pressure.\n\nKey player matchups: Lautaro Mart\u00ednez vs Barcelona's defense, especially since he's returning from injury. Marcus Thuram's impact in the first leg. For Barcelona, Raphinha and Lamine Yamal's performance against Inter's wing-backs. Dumfries' set-piece threat against Barca's defense.\n\nTeam news is crucial. Inter's lineup from the prompt, but according to search results, Inter might have Pavard and Mart\u00ednez back, which wasn't in the predicted lineups. Barcelona's injuries: Balde out, Kound\u00e9 injured, so their defense is weakened. Need to adjust the projected lineups based on the latest info from the sources, like Inigo Martinez playing left-back.\n\nBetting insights should focus on value opportunities. For example, both teams to score (high in the first leg), over 2.5 goals given the attacking styles, and maybe Inter to score over 1.5 goals based on their home form. Also, considering the Asian Handicap line and where the value lies.\n\nPrediction: Given the defensive issues for Barca and Inter's home advantage, a 2-1 win for Inter seems plausible. But the aggregate might be tight. However, the first leg was 3-3, so this leg could go either way. Need to check the Opta supercomputer's 56% chance for Barca to progress, but the match itself might be a draw.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the drama of the first leg, the key players returning from injury, the tactical battle between Inzaghi and Flick, and the historical context of Barca's struggles in Italy. Make it engaging and build excitement for the clash.\n\nCitations: Need to reference the sources properly. For example, the Opta supercomputer stats from [10], Inter's xG efficiency from [9], team news from [16], and first leg details from [11] and [14].\n\nDouble-checking all facts against the search results to ensure accuracy, especially regarding injuries, lineups, and stats. Making sure not to include any unsourced information. Also, ensuring the Asian Handicap analysis correctly interprets the +0.25 line and the value assessment based on the provided odds and implied probabilities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"The Champions League semifinal second leg between Inter Milan and Barcelona at San Siro promises high stakes after a thrilling 3-3 first-leg draw.
