City (4th) come into this match unbeaten in 8 games across all competitions, showing improved defensive organization with 3 clean sheets in their last 5 league matches[8][13]. Wolves (13th) are riding a historic 6-game winning streak - their best top-flight run since 1970[8][13]. The hosts dominate the historical record with 15 wins from 22 meetings, though Wolves shocked City with a 2-1 victory in their last Etihad visit[11][13]. This clash pits Guardiola's possession-based system (89.4% pass accuracy last 5 games[5]) against Wolves' counter-attacking threat led by in-form forwards Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen[13].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Man City vs Wolves match on May 2, 2025. Let's start by reviewing all the search results provided to gather the necessary information. \n\nFirst, looking at the match overview, Man City is 4th in the Premier League and Wolves are 13th. The recent form from search results [8] and [13] indicates that Man City is unbeaten in their last eight games, including three consecutive league wins. Wolves are on a six-game winning streak, their best since 1970. Head-to-head stats from [11] show City has dominated with 15 wins in 22 meetings. The venue is Etihad Stadium, where City has a strong record. \n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -1.5 with City at 2.02 odds. According to [5], City's recent form includes six wins in seven games, high possession stats, and attacking depth. Wolves, despite their form, have faced weaker opponents. The model from [10] gives City a 68.7% chance to win, which translates to an implied odds of around 1.46. The bookmaker's 2.02 odds offer value here. \n\nKey player matchups should focus on De Bruyne vs Wolves' midfield. From [13], Cunha and Strand Larsen are in form for Wolves. The predicted lineups provided in the query need to be incorporated, noting any injuries. Team news from [5] and [8] mentions Wolves' aggressive midfield but City's defensive solidity. \n\nBetting insights should include the Asian Handicap recommendation, over 2.5 goals based on both teams' scoring trends [11][12], and Cunha to score anytime given his form [8][13]. The prediction should be a 3-1 City win, considering their attacking stats and Wolves' defensive vulnerabilities. \n\nIn \"My Say,\" I need to highlight the clash between City's consistency and Wolves' historic streak, making it an exciting matchup. Ensure all citations are correctly referenced from the search results and the JSON structure is strictly followed without any markdown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Manchester City host Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Etihad Stadium in a crucial late-season Premier League clash.
