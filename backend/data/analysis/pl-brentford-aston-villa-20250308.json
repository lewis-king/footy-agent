    "match_overview": "This mid-table Premier League clash sees 11th-placed Brentford host 10th-placed Aston Villa, separated by four points in the standings. Brentford arrive unbeaten in three league games but winless in seven home matches, while Villa seek consistency after winning just once in their last seven league outings. The Villans hold a psychological edge with five consecutive H2H unbeaten matches (W3 D2), including a 3-1 reverse fixture victory[1][3][8]. Both teams demonstrate offensive capability, with Brentford's 48 league goals marginally outperforming Villa's 40, though defensive vulnerabilities plague both sides[1][6].",

Aston Villa miss Amadou Onana (knock) and Ross Barkley (calf), though Barkley nears a UCL return[2][5][8].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Brentford vs Aston Villa Premier League match on March 8, 2025, following a specific JSON structure. The user provided search results from various sources, which I need to use to populate the JSON fields accurately.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the match overview. The search results mention Brentford is 11th and Villa 10th, with a 4-point difference. Brentford's recent form includes being unbeaten in three league games but winless in seven home matches. Villa has one win in seven league games but did well in the FA Cup and Champions League. Their head-to-head shows Villa's recent dominance, especially in goals scored. I'll need to synthesize this into a concise overview.\n\nNext, team news. The sources list several injuries for Brentford: Norgaard, Jensen, Dasilva, Henry, Hickey, Thiago, van den Berg. Villa has Onana and Barkley out. Projected lineups are from [2] and [8]. I need to structure this into the raw and structured sections, ensuring all injured players are listed with reasons if available.\n\nFor the Asian handicap analysis, the line is 0 with odds 1.90 each. The sources mention Villa's better form against Brentford, Brentford's poor home record, and Villa's scoring ability. The handicap table needs to compare form, home/away stats, H2H, and value. The analysis should discuss why Villa is a good pick here, referencing their recent performances and Brentford's injuries.\n\nKey player matchups: Asensio (Villa) has been scoring, and Mbeumo (Brentford) is a key attacker. Also, Watkins vs Brentford's defense, which has been leaky at home. The analysis should highlight these players' recent impacts and how they might affect the game.\n\nBetting insights: Match result (Villa win), Over 2.5 goals (since their past meetings have high scores), Both teams to score (both have offensive capabilities). Need to pull odds from the sources where possible, like [3] and [4].\n\nFinal prediction: The sources lean towards a Villa win, with a 2-1 scoreline mentioned in [1] and [8]. Confidence level around 7/10 because while Villa has the edge, Brentford's home game could be a factor despite their poor form.\n\nI need to ensure all data is correctly cited from the search results. For instance, injuries are detailed in [2], [4], [5], and [8]. The Asian handicap recommendation is supported by [3] and [4]. The score prediction comes from [1] and [8].\n\nAlso, make sure the JSON structure is strictly followed, with all required fields filled. Check for any inconsistencies in the data, like conflicting injury reports or form stats. Cross-reference the sources to ensure accuracy. Avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON format as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This mid-table Premier League clash sees 11th-placed Brentford host 10th-placed Aston Villa, separated by four points in the standings.
