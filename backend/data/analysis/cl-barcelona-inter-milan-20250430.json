    "match_overview": "Barcelona enters this Champions League semi-final first leg in scintillating form, boasting an 11-win streak from their last 14 matches across all competitions[2][6]. Fresh off a dramatic 3-2 Copa del Rey final victory over Real Madrid, Hansi Flick's side combines European pedigree (28 UCL goals this campaign) with domestic dominance (4-point La Liga lead)[2][6]. Inter arrives in Catalonia amidst concerning form - winless in 4 matches with 3 consecutive defeats, including a Coppa Italia exit to Milan[2][5]. Despite being Serie A champions, Simone Inzaghi's men have scored just once in their last 270 minutes of football[5][6]. Historically, Barcelona dominates this fixture with 5 wins in 6 home UCL meetings[6][9].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Champions League match between Barcelona and Inter Milan. They specified using up-to-date information from the provided search results, so I need to carefully go through each source to extract relevant data.\n\nFirst, the match overview. From the search results, I see that Barcelona is in good form, unbeaten in most of their recent matches, including a Copa del Rey win against Real Madrid. Inter, on the other hand, has been struggling with recent losses. I should mention their current standings and recent performances here. Sources [1], [2], [5], and [6] have info on their form and head-to-head stats.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line given is -0.75 for Barcelona at 1.85 odds. I need to compare this with the implied probability. The search results indicate Barcelona's strong home record and Inter's away struggles. Source [6] mentions Barcelona's 55.2% win probability, which translates to around 1.81 odds. The bookmaker's 1.85 offers a slight value. Also, sources [1], [4], and [5] support Barcelona's edge here.\n\nFor key player matchups, Raphinha is highlighted in source [7] as a top scorer in the Champions League. Lautaro Martinez is Inter's main threat, mentioned in [1] and [5]. Comparing their stats and current form from the search results will strengthen this section.\n\nTeam news is provided in the predicted lineups, but I should check the sources for injuries. Source [2] mentions Lewandowski's absence, which is crucial. Also, Inter's injuries like Pavard and Thuram are noted in [2] and [9]. Using the given lineups but verifying with the sources ensures accuracy.\n\nBetting insights need to focus on value opportunities. The over 2.5 goals is supported by Barcelona's high scoring and both teams' tendency to score, as seen in [5] and [7]. Raphinha anytime scorer from [7] and Barcelona to win with BTTS from [4] and [5] are good points. The Asian Handicap value is already discussed.\n\nPrediction should align with the data. A 2-1 win for Barcelona seems common in the sources [5], [6], and [8]. Confidence level around 7/10 because Inter's defense might hold but recent form is poor.\n\nMy_say needs to be engaging. Highlight the historical context from [9], current form, and key players. Mention the tactical battle and what's at stake for both teams to build excitement.\n\nCitations are crucial. Every factual statement needs a source reference. For example, Barcelona's home form from [2] and [6], Inter's away record from [5], and head-to-head stats from [8]. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered based on the search results.\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON structure is strictly followed, with all required sections and proper formatting. Avoid any markdown and stick to the specified keys. Double-check the odds and probabilities for accuracy, especially the Asian Handicap calculations. Also, confirm that all team news and stats are sourced from the provided materials, not prior knowledge.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Barcelona enters this Champions League semi-final first leg in scintillating form, boasting an 11-win streak from their last 14 matches across all competitions[2][6].
