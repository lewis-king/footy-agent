    "match_overview": "Everton host relegated Ipswich Town in a Premier League dead rubber at Goodison Park. The Toffees (15th, 38pts) have secured safety but endured a poor run of 1 win in 9 matches[1][6], while Ipswich (18th, 21pts) arrive with just 1 victory in 2025 and 12 league defeats[1][4]. Historical context favors Everton who won 2-0 in October's reverse fixture[7], though Ipswich's last Goodison victory came in 2002 under George Burley[6]. Both teams' recent xG trends reveal defensive vulnerabilities - Everton average 1.26 xG against/90 while Ipswich concede 1.84 xG/90[11][12].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Everton vs Ipswich. First, I need to review all the provided search results to gather the necessary data. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market.\n\nStarting with the match overview, Everton is 15th with 38 points, safe from relegation, while Ipswich is already relegated. Everton's form is poor, with only one win in nine games. Ipswich has been even worse, with just one win in 2025 and 12 losses. Their head-to-head shows Everton won the last meeting 2-0, but Ipswich had a win in 2002. Recent form and context are crucial here.\n\nFor team news, the predicted lineups are given. Everton's lineup includes Pickford, Mykolenko, Branthwaite, O'Brien, Patterson, Gueye, Garner, Ndiaye, Doucoure, McNeil, Broja. Ipswich's lineup has Palmer, Greaves, Burgess, Woolfenden, O'Shea, Morsy, Taylor, Clarke, Enciso, Hutchinson, Delap. Injuries and suspensions need to be sourced from the search results. From source [6], Everton might be missing Calvert-Lewin, Lindstrom, Mangala, and Tarkowski. Ipswich's Davis is suspended, Philogene and Ogbene out, but Muric and Hutchinson might return. Need to structure this into injuries and suspensions for both teams.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -1.0 for Everton at 1.89. From source [4], Everton's Asian Handicap home win rate is 50%, and Ipswich's away is 40%. Source [2] and [3] suggest Everton has around 60% chance to win. The implied probability for 1.89 is ~52.9%, but the model suggests 60.4%, indicating value. Need to compare the odds' implied probability vs the model's probability.\n\nKey player matchups: Look for players who can influence the game. From source [9], O'Brien's aerial threat against Ipswich's set-piece weakness. Also, Enciso vs Gueye in midfield could be crucial. Need to reference xG stats from sources [5] and [11].\n\nBetting insights: Under 2.5 goals seems likely as Everton's games average 2.21 goals, and Ipswich's defense is poor. Everton to win to nil could have value given Ipswich's low scoring. Correct score 2-0 Everton is probable based on simulations.\n\nPrediction: Everton 2-0 with medium confidence. Reasoning based on form, home advantage, and Ipswich's struggles.\n\nMy Say: Need a engaging narrative, maybe highlight Moyes' return, Everton's defense, Ipswich's relegation, and the dead rubber context. Use vivid language to set the scene.\n\nCitations: Ensure every factual statement is backed by the search results. For example, Everton's form from [1], Ipswich's relegation from [1], xG stats from [5][11], etc. Need to map each fact to the correct source index.\n\nMake sure all odds are in decimal format, avoid American terms. Check Asian Handicap line accuracy as per user's note. Structure the JSON correctly, include all required sections with raw and structured data. Verify that team news uses the given lineups and sourced injuries/suspensions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Everton host relegated Ipswich Town in a Premier League dead rubber at Goodison Park.
