    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by breaking down the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Premier League match between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City. The key points they mentioned include match overview, team news, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, betting insights, and a final score prediction. Plus, the response needs to be in a specific JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results. Let me review each source carefully. \n\nLooking at the team news:\n- For Manchester City, sources [1], [4], and [5] mention injuries. Manuel Akanji is out, possibly for the season. Rodri, John Stones, Oscar Bobb, and Nathan Ake are also injured. However, there's mention of Doku and Gvardiol returning from the bench in a previous match, so they might start. Jack Grealish is another injury concern from [1], but the latest updates might have more info. Wait, [5] lists Guardiola's injured players as Rodri, Bobb, Akanji, Stones, Ake. Grealish isn't mentioned there, maybe he's back? Or perhaps the sources conflict. Need to check dates. The sources are from March 2025, so recent. So, City's injuries include Rodri, Stones, Akanji, Bobb, Ake. Grealish's status isn't clear here. Maybe he's fit, but [1] says he limped off in a previous game. Hmm. But in [5], the team news for City doesn't list Grealish. So maybe he's available? Or maybe the sources differ. Need to reconcile this. The user wants structured team news, so I'll have to list the confirmed injuries from the sources. For City, according to [5], the injured are Rodri, Bobb, Akanji, Stones, Ake. Grealish isn't listed there. So perhaps he's fit. But in [1], Akanji is reported to be out long-term. So structured injuries for City would be those players. \n\nFor Nottingham Forest, sources [2] and [4] mention injuries. [2] lists Neco Williams and Nicolas Dominguez as injured. [4] mentions Carlos Miguel as the only confirmed absentee. So in the structured team news, Forest's injuries would be Miguel, Williams, Dominguez. Suspensions? [5] says none for Forest. \n\nProjected lineups: For Forest, [4] mentions Chris Wood returning to the starting XI. So probable lineup with Wood. For City, [4] suggests Marmoush, Gvardiol, Doku might start after being on the bench. But I need to consider their usual starters. Without Rodri, Stones, etc., City's lineup might have Lewis, maybe Kovacic in midfield. \n\nNext, the Asian handicap analysis. The line is 0, with both teams at 1.90. The user wants a table with form, home/away form, H2H, and value. From the search results, [3] gives odds, with City as favorites. H2H stats in [5] show City has 44 wins vs Forest's 33. Recent H2H, [4] mentions City scoring 14 goals in last 5 league meetings. Forest's home form is strong, unbeaten in 9 home games per [4]. City's away form is good but with key injuries. \n\nKey player matchups: For example, Chris Wood against City's defense, which is missing Akanji and Stones. Maybe Gvardiol vs Forest's wingers. Also, Doku's pace against Forest's full-backs. \n\nBetting insights: [4] predicts a 1-1 draw. [6] suggests Forest +0.5 Asian handicap. [3] has over 2.5 goals at 1.62. So markets like match result, over/under, both teams to score. \n\nFinal score prediction: Considering Forest's home form and City's injuries, a draw seems possible. [4] predicts 1-1. Confidence level maybe 7/10? \n\nNow, structuring all this into the JSON format. Making sure to include raw and structured team news, Asian handicap analysis with table, key matchups, betting insights, and prediction. Also, need to cite sources where applicable. \n\nWait, in the JSON, how to handle citations? The instructions say to inline cite with [1][2], but the JSON needs to be valid. Since the user's instructions say to follow the JSON schema exactly, I'll omit the citations in the JSON but ensure the info is based on the provided sources. \n\nDouble-checking all data points against the sources to ensure accuracy. For example, Forest's injuries: [2] shows Williams and Dominguez; [4] mentions Carlos Miguel. So three injured players. City's injuries as per [5] are Rodri, Bobb, Akanji, Stones, Ake. \n\nProjected lineups: For City, without Rodri, maybe Kovacic and Nunes in midfield. Defense without Akanji and Stones, so Dias and Gvardiol? Doku and Foden on wings. For Forest, Wood up front, maybe Elanga and Hudson-Odoi on wings. \n\nAsian Handicap analysis: Forest's home form is strong, City's away form is good but with injuries. H2H favors City, but current form may tilt towards a close match. Value might be on Forest +0.5. \n\nBetting insights: Draw in match result, under 2.5 goals, both teams to score. \n\nFinal score prediction: 1-1 with confidence 7/10. \n\nNow, putting all into the JSON structure as specified. Making sure all required fields are present and the data aligns with the sources. Cross-verifying each section for completeness and accuracy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"A crucial Premier League clash sees 3rd-placed Nottingham Forest host 4th-placed Manchester City at The City Ground.
