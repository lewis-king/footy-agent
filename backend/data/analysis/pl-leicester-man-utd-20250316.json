    "match_overview": "This Premier League clash sees 18th-placed Leicester host 12th-placed Manchester United at the King Power Stadium. Leicester's six consecutive home losses without scoring (a Premier League record [5]) contrasts sharply with United's six-match unbeaten run across competitions [7]. The visitors have dominated recent encounters, winning all three meetings this season (5-2 EFL Cup, 3-0 PL, 2-1 FA Cup) while keeping clean sheets in their last two league visits [1][3][7]. Tactically, Leicester's shift to a 3-4-2-1 system under Van Nistelrooy has yet to yield results, while Ruben Amorim's United show growing defensive stability with teenager Ayden Heaven impressing in central defense [4][7].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Premier League match between Leicester and Manchester United on March 16, 2025, with specific sections like match overview, Asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, team news, betting insights, prediction, and a journalist-style conclusion. The user emphasized using up-to-date sourced information and adhering strictly to the JSON format provided. \n\nFirst, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results. Let me go through each source one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] from sportsgambler.com mentions Manchester United's recent form, their odds at -120, and a predicted 1-0 win. It also notes that both teams have been covering the 9.5 total corners line recently. The correct score prediction here is 1-0 to Man Utd at +700. This source also provides team news, like Mason Mount's return to the squad. \n\nResult [2] from xgscore.io gives xG stats from their November 2024 match. Man Utd had a higher xG (0.94 vs Leicester's 0.60) and more possession. This could be useful for data-driven insights, especially in the key player matchups and betting insights sections. \n\nResult [3] on wintips.com lists past H2H results, showing Man Utd's dominance with recent wins, including a 3-0 and 5-2 victory. It also mentions their current form, which is a 60% win rate. However, the user specified using the lineups provided in the prompt, so I should cross-check that with the predicted lineups given. \n\nResult [4] from standard.co.uk provides confirmed team news for Man Utd. Mason Mount is back on the bench, and players like Yoro, Evans, Martinez are injured. The predicted lineup includes De Ligt, Heaven, Lindelof in defense, and Ugarte in midfield. This aligns with the user's provided away team lineup. \n\nResult [5] from betus.com.pa highlights betting trends: Leicester's poor home form, Man Utd's away record, and Bruno Fernandes' scoring form. The ML recommendation for Man Utd at -120 and Fernandes to score at +300 are key points here. \n\nResult [6] from footballwhispers.com predicts a 1-2 scoreline for Man Utd, citing Leicester's low scoring and Man Utd's improvement under Amorim. The H2H record is also emphasized here. \n\nResult [7] from football365.com gives expected lineups for both teams, which match the user's provided lineups. It also mentions Leicester's recent tactical change to a 3-4-2-1 formation and their six consecutive losses. Man Utd's injury list and potential lineup adjustments are noted, which is useful for team news. \n\nResult [8] from sgodds.com provides current odds, showing Man Utd as favorites with 51% chance. The Asian Handicap line is Leicester +0.5, which the user specified. The opening odds for the Asian Handicap are Leicester +0.50 at 2.00 and Man Utd -0.5 at 1.95. \n\nNow, structuring each section:\n\n**Match Overview**: Highlight recent form (Leicester's 6 losses, Man Utd's unbeaten run), H2H dominance, tactical changes (Leicester's 3-4-2-1), and key stats like xG. Use sources [1][5][6][7].\n\n**Asian Handicap Analysis**: The line is Leicester +0.5, so Man Utd needs to win by 1 goal. Analyze Man Utd's away form, Leicester's home struggles, and recent H2H. Sources [1][5][8].\n\n**Key Player Matchups**: Bruno Fernandes vs Ndidi/Soumare (source [5][7]), Garnacho vs Kristiansen (speed vs defensive weakness, source [7]), Vardy vs De Ligt (experience vs young defender, source [7]).\n\n**Team News**: Use the provided lineups and supplement with injury info from sources [4][7]. Leicester's lineup from [7], Man Utd's injuries from [4][7].\n\n**Betting Insights**: \n1. Asian Handicap Man Utd -0.5 at 1.92 (source [8]), based on H2H and form.\n2. Bruno Fernandes anytime scorer at +300 (source [5]).\n3. Under 2.5 Goals at 2.00 (source [8]), considering Leicester's low scoring and Man Utd's away games.\n4. Man Utd to win to nil at 3.20 (source [1][6]).\n\n**Prediction**: 2-0 to Man Utd, confidence 7/10. Reasoning: Leicester's scoring issues, Man Utd's defensive improvements, and Fernandes' form.\n\n**My Say**: Journalist-style wrap-up, emphasizing the tactical battle, Amorim's impact, Leicester's struggles, and key players. Use a quirky angle about Van Nistelrooy facing his former club.\n\nNeed to ensure all citations are correctly referenced from the sources. Also, check that odds are in decimal format as required. For example, source [1] mentions -120 for Man Utd, which converts to 1.83 decimal. However, the user provided Asian Handicap odds as 2.06 (Leicester +0.5) and 1.92 (Man Utd -0.5), which should be used directly. \n\nDouble-checking the Asian Handicap line: The user specified it's +0.5 for Leicester, so Man Utd -0.5. The analysis should explain that Man Utd needs to win by at least 1 goal for the bet to win. \n\nEnsuring that all facts are sourced from the provided results and not prior knowledge. For example, Leicester's six consecutive home losses without scoring comes from source [5]. Man Utd's unbeaten run from [7]. \n\nIn the team news, using the lineups provided but also incorporating injury info from sources [4] and [7]. For instance, Man Utd's missing players like Martinez, Yoro, Evans, and Dorgu's suspension. \n\nFinally, the JSON structure must be strictly followed, with correct sectioning and citation indices. Each citation should correspond to the source numbers provided. Make sure all odds are in decimal format as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League clash sees 18th-placed Leicester host 12th-placed Manchester United at the King Power Stadium.
