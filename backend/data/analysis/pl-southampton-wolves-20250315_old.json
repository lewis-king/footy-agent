    "match_overview": "Saturday's relegation six-pointer at St Mary's pits Premier League basement dwellers Southampton (9 points) against a Wolves side (23 points) seeking to virtually secure survival. The Saints have lost 8 consecutive home games while conceding 2.85 GPG at St Mary's [12][14], whereas Wolves arrive with 6 straight H2H wins against Southampton including a 2-0 reverse fixture victory in November [11][7]. Despite missing suspended top scorer Matheus Cunha (13 goals), Wolves' xG of 1.12 against Everton's stout defense last week demonstrates their attacking resilience [13]. Southampton's -48 GD is the worst in Premier League history through 28 games [8], with their 64% Over 2.5 goals ratio suggesting defensive vulnerability [10].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this detailed betting analysis for the Southampton vs Wolves Premier League match. The user wants a comprehensive JSON report based on the provided search results. First, I need to start with the match overview. From the search results, Southampton is bottom of the table with only 9 points, struggling defensively, and on a losing streak at home. Wolves are six points clear of relegation, have a better form, and a strong head-to-head record against Southampton, including six consecutive wins. The recent draw against Everton and injuries/suspensions for Wolves, especially Cunha being out, are key points here.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line given is +0.25 for Southampton, with odds of 2.15 and 1.84 for Wolves. From the sources, Wolves are favorites with a 46% win probability. Their away form is better than Southampton's home form. The value seems to be on Wolves here, especially given Southampton's defensive issues. The analysis should highlight Wolves' expected slight edge and recommend Wolves -0.25.\n\nFor key player matchups, Sulemana vs Doherty is important. Sulemana has speed, but Doherty's experience could counter that. Joao Gomes vs Aribo in midfield is another key battle, with Gomes' recent form and defensive stats being better. Also, Ramsdale's performance against Wolves' attack, which has been scoring consistently, is crucial.\n\nTeam news needs to reflect current injuries and suspensions. From the sources, Southampton is missing Bednarek, Smallbone, Bree, Fraser, Stewart, and Larios. Wolves are without Cunha (suspended), Agbadou, Mosquera, Gonz\u00e1lez, Kalajdzic, and Munetsi is doubtful. The projected lineups should match the predicted ones from the search results, like Bella-Kotchap and Harwood-Bellis as CBs for Southampton, and Semedo, Doherty in defense for Wolves.\n\nBetting insights should include Wolves to win, Both Teams to Score (since Saints have conceded in 6 straight), and maybe Over 2.5 goals given both teams' defensive issues. Odds from the sources mention Wolves at 2.06, BTTS Yes at 1.70, Over 2.5 at 1.85. Need to check which sources have these odds.\n\nPrediction: Wolves to win 2-1, considering their H2H dominance and Saints' defensive woes. Confidence around 7/10 because Wolves are missing Cunha but still have enough quality.\n\nMy_say section should be engaging, maybe referencing the relegation battle, Wolves' recent resilience, Saints' desperation, and key players. Use vivid language to set the scene.\n\nNow, verifying all data points against the sources. For example, Wolves' six straight wins against Southampton is from [11] and [7]. Saints' defensive stats from [3] and [10]. Team news from [2], [3], [6], [12]. Odds from [1], [4], [12]. Key players from [1], [6], [13]. Ensuring each fact is cited correctly with the source indices.\n\nNeed to structure the JSON correctly, include all sections, use the right citation indices, and ensure the raw fields have additional insights. Also, check that the Asian Handicap analysis aligns with the given line and odds. Make sure the recommendations are actionable and data-driven, referencing xG, recent form, H2H, etc. Avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON structure specified. Double-check that all information is up-to-date based on the provided search results (current date is March 15, 2025).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Saturday's relegation six-pointer at St Mary's pits Premier League basement dwellers Southampton (9 points) against a Wolves side (23 points) seeking to virtually secure survival.
