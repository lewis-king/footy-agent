    "match_overview": "Nottingham Forest host Brentford at City Ground in a crucial Premier League clash as they push for European qualification. Forest sit 6th with 60 points, needing wins to close the gap on Chelsea, while Brentford languish in 11th with fading European hopes[2][5]. Forest's recent 1-0 win over Tottenham showcased their defensive resilience, though their FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City revealed vulnerability against top-tier attacks[6]. Brentford arrive fresh from a 14-day break following their 4-2 demolition of Brighton, where they demonstrated clinical finishing with 3.4 post-shot xG[3][10]. Historically, Forest dominate H2H at home with 8 wins in 24 meetings, though Brentford's recent +1.5 handicap record in away games suggests defensive organization[8][11].",

Forest's -0.25 line at 2.0 - a price that doesn't fully account for their 63.6% ATS record against opponents with Brentford's travel sickness. Expect Wood to bully Collins in aerial duels, Murillo to walk the tightrope against Mbeumo's trickery, and ultimately, Forest's Champions League hunger to prevail in a thriller that keeps their European dreams alive."

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the task. The user wants a detailed betting analysis for the Nottingham Forest vs Brentford Premier League match on May 1, 2025. They specified using the given lineups and the provided search results. I need to structure this in JSON following the schema provided.\n\nFirst, the match overview. I should check recent form from the search results. Search result [2] mentions Nottingham Forest's recent win over Tottenham and FA Cup loss to Man City. Brentford had a 4-2 win over Brighton. Head-to-head from [8] says Forest has three draws in the last six meetings. Also, [11] notes Brentford's +1.5 handicap in recent away games. I need to combine these into a concise overview.\n\nNext, team news. The predicted lineups are provided, so I need to structure that. Injuries and suspensions: search result [6] mentions Sels as the breakout star, so maybe he's key. Wait, the user said to use the lineups given, so maybe no injuries unless mentioned. Checking the search results, [8] mentions injuries but doesn't specify. Maybe the sources don't provide injury info, so I'll state that no major injuries are reported based on the given data.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.25 with Forest at 2.0 odds. From [1], Forest is favored at +115 (which is around 2.15 decimal). Search [3] mentions Forest's seven straight EPL wins as favorites. Their home form is strong, 10-6-0 ATS as per [3]. Brentford's away form is mixed. Using xG stats from [9] and [13], Forest's xG at home is 1.42, Brentford's away xG is 1.25. This suggests Forest might have an edge. The handicap value might be in Forest -0.25 at 2.0, considering their home form and Brentford's away struggles.\n\nKey player matchups. Chris Wood vs Brentford's defense. From [5], Wood has 19 goals. Mbeumo with 18 goals for Brentford. Murillo vs Mbeumo could be a key duel. Also, Gibbs-White's creativity against Brentford's midfield. Need to cite sources where possible, like [5] for Wood's stats.\n\nBetting insights. Over 2.5 goals is mentioned in [3] and [4], but [4] predicts under. Need to reconcile. [3]'s model predicts over based on Brentford's high-event away games. Also, Forest's home xG and Brentford's away xG. Maybe over 2.5 is a good bet. Nottingham to win at 2.23 from [2]. Both teams to score: [6] says 45% of Forest games have both scoring. Maybe BTTS yes. Also, considering Asian Handicap value on Forest.\n\nPrediction. Forest's home form and Brentford's away issues. Score prediction 2-1 from [8]. Confidence level around 7/10. Reasoning based on home advantage and xG stats.\n\nMy Say. Need a engaging narrative, maybe highlighting Forest's European push and Brentford's mid-table position. Mention key players and tactical aspects. Use vivid language to set the scene.\n\nCitations: Need to map each fact to the search results. For example, Forest's home form from [3], xG stats from [9] and [13], head-to-head from [8], etc. Ensure each citation is correctly numbered.\n\nFinally, structure all into the JSON schema, ensuring all fields are filled with the sourced data and proper citations. Check for any missing elements like team news injuries or suspensions, and if not available, note that based on the provided data. Make sure odds are in decimal format and Asian Handicap analysis is accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Nottingham Forest host Brentford at City Ground in a crucial Premier League clash as they push for European qualification.
