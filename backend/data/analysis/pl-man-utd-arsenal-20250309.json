    "match_overview": "This Premier League clash sees 14th-placed Manchester United host title-chasing Arsenal at Old Trafford in starkly different circumstances. While Arsenal (WWWDL) remain 21 points behind Liverpool, their 7-1 Champions League demolition of PSV [1][7] underscores their attacking potential. United's WDLWD form masks deeper issues - they've lost 7 home league games [1][7] and face a defensive crisis with Maguire (doubt), Martinez (ACL), Evans (back) and Dorgu (suspended) absent [9][11][13]. Arsenal's last 5 away games against bottom-half teams produced 5 wins [7], while United's midfield crisis worsens with Mainoo (injured) and Ugarte (doubt) [11][13]. Historical context adds spice - United knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup on penalties in January despite being out-xG'd 2.71 to 0.27 [5].",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a detailed betting analysis for the upcoming Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal. The user is a professional betting analyst, so the response needs to be data-driven, using the provided search results for accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the analysis according to the specified JSON format. The sections required are match_overview, asian_handicap_analysis, key_player_matchups, team_news, betting_insights, prediction, and my_say. Each section must be filled with relevant information, properly cited from the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- [1] Discusses Arsenal's defensive strength and Manchester United's injury issues, especially in midfield and defense. Also mentions Arsenal's set-piece threat and United's poor set-piece defense.\n- [2] Provides odds and a prediction model favoring Arsenal with 69.5% chance to win.\n- [3] Opta's analysis suggests Arsenal's likelihood to win, mentions United's xG underperformance, and possible under 2.5 goals.\n- [4] Highlights United's injury crisis and Arsenal's defensive record, predicting a 0-2 win for Arsenal.\n- [5] FA Cup match where United beat Arsenal on penalties, but that's from an earlier match (Jan 2025) which might not reflect current form.\n- [6] More emphasis on Arsenal's Champions League thrashing of PSV and United's struggles.\n- [7] Gives betting tips supporting Arsenal to win at 1.73 odds.\n- [8] Talks about Arsenal's finishing slump but indicates it's a temporary issue.\n- [9], [11], [13] Detail United's injuries: Maguire, Mainoo, Shaw, Diallo, Martinez, Evans, others. Key absences in defense and midfield.\n- [10] Arsenal's xG stats against Man City, showing their attacking efficiency.\n- [12] Arsenal's reliance on set-pieces and Jesus' performance against United.\n\nNow, building each section:\n\n**match_overview**: Need to cover both teams' forms, recent performances, context like injuries, and head-to-head. Use sources [1], [4], [5], [7], [9], [11], [13].\n\n**asian_handicap_analysis**: Since the user didn't provide specific lines, infer from the context. Arsenal are strong favorites, so the handicap might be -1.0 or similar. Use data from [2], [3], [7] which mention Arsenal's chances and United's weaknesses.\n\n**key_player_matchups**: Identify players like Merino (Arsenal) vs United's weakened midfield, Gabriel's aerial threat vs Lindelof. Use [1], [3], [12].\n\n**team_news**: Compile injuries from [9], [11], [13], and projected lineups from [1], [4], [7].\n\n**betting_insights**: Look for value bets like Arsenal to win, under 2.5 goals, Arsenal to score from a set-piece. Use [1], [2], [3], [7], [12].\n\n**prediction**: Predict Arsenal win 2-0, citing their defensive strength and United's injury crisis. Use [4], [7], [1].\n\n**my_say**: Craft a narrative around the clash, Arsenal's momentum, United's struggles, key absences. Make it engaging and insightful, using [1], [3], [4], [7].\n\nCitations must be correctly applied. For example, when mentioning United's injuries, cite [9][11][13]. For Arsenal's set-piece strength, cite [1][12].\n\nNeed to ensure all facts are from the provided sources and avoid using external knowledge. Also, convert odds to decimal where necessary, like Arsenal's moneyline at -135 being around 1.74 in decimal.\n\nCheck for accuracy in Asian Handicap analysis. Since the user mentioned not to assume lines, but the sources suggest Arsenal is a strong favorite, so the handicap line might be -1.0. However, some sources like [3] mention United +2 handicap, but that's too high. The main line to consider is -1.0, which is a common handicap for such a fixture.\n\nEnsure that all statistics, like United's home losses, Arsenal's away form, are correctly cited from the sources. For example, [7] mentions Arsenal's away record against bottom-half teams, which is relevant.\n\nAlso, note that in [5], despite United beating Arsenal in the FA Cup, that was a different context (cup match, penalties) and with a different lineup due to injuries now. So current form and squad status are more relevant.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Mixing up past and present form, misattributing injury status. Need to cross-reference sources [9], [11], [13] for accurate injury lists.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the JSON format, ensuring proper syntax and that all fields are addressed. The 'my_say' section should be engaging, perhaps highlighting the tactical battle or key duels, using vivid language.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"This Premier League clash sees 14th-placed Manchester United host title-chasing Arsenal at Old Trafford in starkly different circumstances.
