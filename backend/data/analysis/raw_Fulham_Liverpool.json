"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Fulham vs Liverpool. First, I need to start by gathering all the relevant information from the search results provided. The user wants a detailed, data-driven analysis focusing on value opportunities, especially in the Asian Handicap market. \n\nStarting with the match overview, I need to look at recent form and head-to-head stats. From the search results, Liverpool's form is strong with only one loss in the league, and they've been dominant against Fulham historically. The recent H2H shows Liverpool has won most encounters, including a 3-1 win at Craven Cottage last season. Fulham's form is mixed, with some wins but inconsistency, especially at home. They lost to Crystal Palace and Arsenal recently but beat Tottenham. That's a key point to mention.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is Fulham +0.75 at 1.84 odds. I need to determine if there's value here. Looking at Liverpool's away form, they've won against tough teams like Man City and Newcastle. Fulham's home form isn't stellar, with some losses. The xG data from source [3] shows Liverpool's expected supremacy. Also, the handicap line seems to undervalue Liverpool's dominance. So recommending Liverpool -0.75 at 2.0 odds makes sense here because their actual performance suggests they can cover the spread.\n\nKey player matchups: Salah vs Robinson is crucial. Salah has 27 goals and 17 assists, while Robinson has 10 assists but might struggle defensively. Van Dijk vs Jimenez is another point; Jimenez has 10 goals but Van Dijk's stats are solid. Mac Allister controlling the midfield against Fulham's Berge and Lukic, who have lower defensive contributions. These matchups favor Liverpool.\n\nTeam news: From sources [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], Fulham has injuries to Tete, Wilson, Nelson. Liverpool might miss Alisson (doubtful), Alexander-Arnold, Gomez. The predicted lineups are given, but I should note the defensive gaps for Fulham and Liverpool's makeshift right-back situation with Curtis Jones. This could affect their defensive stability but Liverpool's attack is still strong.\n\nBetting insights: \n1. Liverpool to win at 1.83 odds. Their form and H2H support this. \n2. Over 3.5 goals. Past meetings have high scores, and both teams have attacking players. \n3. Salah to score. He's in great form and Fulham's defense is vulnerable. \n\nPrediction: Liverpool 3-1. Their attacking quality and Fulham's defensive issues support this. \n\nMy Say: Need to create an engaging narrative. Highlight Liverpool's title charge, Fulham's European hopes, key players, and the tactical battle. Mention the venue's atmosphere and historical context.\n\nI need to ensure all facts are sourced correctly. For example, xG data from [3], H2H from [1], injury news from [9], [13]. Also, check the odds formatting as decimals and verify the Asian Handicap line is correctly interpreted. Avoid any markdown and stick to JSON structure. Make sure citations are correctly applied in the analysis using the provided sources. Finally, review all sections to ensure they align with the guidelines and cover all required aspects.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Liverpool enter this fixture as Premier League leaders with a 12-point advantage, needing just 8 points from their remaining 9 games to secure the title[1][5].

Watch for Salah's trademark cut-inside demolition of Robinson, whose marauding runs leave gaps even Usain Bolt couldn't recover. With Fulham's European dreams clinging to life support, their Brazilian trio of Willian, Andreas, and Jim\u00e9nez must channel the spirit of 1970s Jairzinho - but against Van Dijk's 6'4'' colossus, even Pel\u00e9 might struggle. This isn't just a football match; it's a tactical chess match where Klopp's queen (Salah) threatens checkmate by halftime.\"\n  },\n  \"citations\": [\n    {\"id\": \"1\", \"url\": \"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/704586/liverpool-fulham\", \"description\": \"Match stats and historical data\"},\n    {\"id\": \"2\", \"url\": \"https://sports.ladbrokes.com/news/match-preview-fulham-liverpool-premier-league-april-6-2025/\", \"description\": \"Form guide and predictions\"},\n    {\"id\": \"3\", \"url\": \"https://www.planetsport.com/soccer/news/fulham-v-liverpool-prediction-tips-and-bet-builder-as-reds-continue-title-march\", \"description\": \"xG analysis and bet builder\"},\n    {\"id\": \"4\", \"url\": \"https://www.actionnetwork.com/epl-game/liverpool-fulham/249248\", \"description\": \"Odds movement and betting trends\"},\n    {\"id\": \"5\", \"url\": \"https://theanalyst.com/2023/12/liverpool-vs-fulham-prediction\", \"description\": \"Historical H2H and statistical models\"},\n    {\"id\": \"7\", \"url\": \"https://www.docsports.com/free-picks/soccer/2025/fulham-vs-liverpool-prediction-4-6-2025-soccer-pick-tips-and-odds.html\", \"description\": \"Defensive and offensive metrics\"},\n    {\"id\": \"9\", \"url\": \"https://www.londonworld.com/sport/football/fulham/fulham-injury-updates-liverpool-5067219\", \"description\": \"Fulham injury updates\"},\n    {\"id\": \"10\", \"url\": \"https://www.squawka.com/en/news/liverpool-team-news-vs-fulham-predicted-lineup/\", \"description\": \"Liverpool lineup projections\"},\n    {\"id\": \"11\", \"url\": \"https://anfieldindex.com/80651/liverpool-starting-xi-vs-fulham-confirmed-team-news-and-predicted-lineup.html\", \"description\": \"Defensive absences analysis\"},\n    {\"id\": \"12\", \"url\": \"https://www.sportsgambler.com/betting-tips/football/fulham-vs-liverpool-prediction-lineups-odds-2025-04-06/\", \"description\": \"Tactical matchup data\"},\n    {\"id\": \"13\", \"url\": \"https://www.liverpoolworld.uk/sport/football/liverpool/fulham-vs-liverpool-early-injury-news-premier-league-5066123\", \"description\": \"Injury timeline details\"},\n    {\"id\": \"14\", \"url\": \"https://onefootball.com/en/news/liverpool-team-news-vs-fulham-and-predicted-lineup-40925525\", \"description\": \"Midfield dynamics\"},\n    {\"id\": \"15\", \"url\": \"https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/title-race/injuries-and-suspensions/alisson-availability-trent-latest-liverpool-injury-list-for-fulham-clash_569293.html\", \"description\": \"Goalkeeper status update\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
