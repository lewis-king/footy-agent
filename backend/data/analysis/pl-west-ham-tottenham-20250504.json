Both teams arrive in dismal form - West Ham winless in seven (3D 4L) while Spurs have one win in eight (1W 1D 6L)[1][4]. The October reverse fixture saw Tottenham dominate 4-1[1], but they've failed to win at London Stadium since 2019[2]. West Ham's defense remains leaky (1.71 GA/game) while Spurs show flickers of attacking promise (77 shots last 5 games)[2][8].

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the West Ham vs Tottenham match. Let's start by going through the provided search results to gather relevant data.\n\nFirst, the match overview. Both teams are struggling in the league. West Ham is 17th, Tottenham 16th. Recent form is poor for both. West Ham hasn't won in seven league games, Tottenham one win in eight. Head-to-head: Tottenham won 4-1 in October, but haven't won at London Stadium since 2019. That's from [1], [2], [4], [8], [15].\n\nFor team news, West Ham has injuries like Alvarez, Antonio, Summerville [12]. Tottenham's Bergvall is out, Maddison and Solanke might be rested [6], [14]. Using the predicted lineups provided in the query.\n\nAsian Handicap analysis: The line is -0.25 for West Ham. From [4], West Ham's home form is 5-8-4, Tottenham's away form not great. Stats from [9] show Tottenham has better xG but higher conceded. [2] suggests Tottenham's corners and possession might help. But West Ham's defensive issues [8] and Tottenham's inconsistency. The odds 2.03 vs 1.92. Maybe slight value on Tottenham +0.25 as they have better xG and recent H2H win.\n\nKey player matchups: Bowen vs Tottenham's defense. Bowen has 10 goals [6], Tottenham's defense has been shaky [1]. Maddison if he plays could influence midfield. Richarlison's form [2].\n\nBetting insights: BTTS Yes is supported by both teams' defensive records [4], [15]. Over 2.5 goals from [4], [15]. Corners over 9.5 from [2]. Also, considering the Asian Handicap value on Tottenham.\n\nPrediction: Maybe a 2-1 win for Tottenham, but considering the H2H and recent form, maybe a draw. Confidence 6/10.\n\nMy Say: Highlight the relegation battle context, both teams' struggles, key players, and the derby atmosphere. Use stats from the sources to make it engaging.\n\nNeed to ensure all facts are sourced from the provided results, cite properly, and structure the JSON correctly.
