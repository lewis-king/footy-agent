    "match_overview": "Crystal Palace hosts Nottingham Forest at Selhurst Park in a Premier League clash with contrasting motivations. Palace (12th) enter buoyed by their recent FA Cup final qualification [6][8], displaying improved attacking form with 7 goals in their last 5 matches [5]. Forest's early-season promise has evaporated, suffering 6 defeats in their last 10 league games while scoring just 3 goals in their previous 4 matches [6]. The Reds' Champions League ambitions have collapsed due to defensive fragility (1.69 xGA/match) [2] and Chris Wood's scoring drought (1 goal in 9 games) [6]. Palace's home advantage (27,980 avg attendance [2]) and set-piece threat (20 corners in last 5 games [5]) could prove decisive against Forest's struggling backline.",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this Crystal Palace vs. Nottingham Forest betting analysis. First, I need to make sure I follow all the guidelines and structure the JSON properly. Let's start by reviewing the search results provided.\n\nFrom the search results, I see that Crystal Palace is 12th in the Premier League and has an upcoming FA Cup final against Man City. Their recent form includes draws and wins, and they've scored seven goals in their last five matches. Nottingham Forest, on the other hand, was initially strong but has been slipping, with six recent losses. They're struggling to score, especially Chris Wood, who has only one goal in nine games. Hudson-Odoi's injury is mentioned, which affects their creativity.\n\nLooking at the team news, the predicted lineups are given in the query, so I should use those. The sources mention injuries and suspensions, but I need to check which ones are relevant. For example, source [6] notes Hudson-Odoi's absence, which I should include in the away team's injuries.\n\nFor the Asian Handicap analysis, the line is -0.25 for Palace. The odds are 1.99 for home and 1.94 for away. According to source [5], there's a recommendation for Palace's Draw No Bet, which aligns with the Asian Handicap. The expected goals (xG) data from sources [3] and [4] can be used to compare both teams' offensive and defensive performances. Palace's xG is higher in recent matches, suggesting they create better chances.\n\nKey player matchups should focus on Eze vs. Forest's midfield. Eze's form is highlighted in source [5], and Gibbs-White's role for Forest is crucial. Their head-to-head in midfield could dictate the game's tempo.\n\nBetting insights need to identify value. Source [7] gives a 46.1% chance for Palace to win, which converts to about 2.17 odds. The bookmaker's 1.99 is lower, so maybe not value here. However, looking at both teams to score, Palace's defense has issues, and Forest might struggle without Hudson-Odoi. The over/under 2.5 goals could be a good bet based on recent stats.\n\nIn the prediction, considering Forest's poor away form and Palace's home advantage, a 2-1 win for Palace seems plausible. The confidence level is 7/10 because of Forest's potential to bounce back but their recent form is worrying.\n\nFor \"my_say,\" I need to craft a engaging narrative. Maybe highlight the contrast between Palace's FA Cup excitement and Forest's desperation to regain form. Use vivid language to set the scene at Selhurst Park.\n\nCitations are crucial. Every fact needs a source. For example, Palace's recent goals from [5], Forest's decline from [6], xG stats from [3] and [4]. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered and corresponds to the sources provided.\n\nI need to double-check all stats against the sources to ensure accuracy. Also, avoid using any base knowledge not found in the provided search results. Stick strictly to the data given to maintain credibility.\n\nFinally, structure everything into the required JSON format, ensuring all sections are covered with detailed analysis and proper citations. Make sure the Asian Handicap analysis clearly explains why Palace -0.25 is a value bet based on their recent form and Forest's struggles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Crystal Palace hosts Nottingham Forest at Selhurst Park in a Premier League clash with contrasting motivations.
