    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this betting analysis for Brighton vs West Ham. First, I need to start with the match overview. From the search results, Brighton's recent form isn't great\u2014they're winless in six games, including a 4-2 loss to Brentford. West Ham drew 1-1 with Southampton. Head-to-head, West Ham is unbeaten in the last three meetings, but Brighton has a strong home record against them. I should mention their positions in the league table: Brighton 10th, West Ham 17th. That sets the context.\n\nNext, the Asian Handicap analysis. The line is -0.75 for Brighton at 1.89. I need to check if there's value here. Search result [4] suggests Brighton's home form is strong despite recent struggles, with a better xG and shot numbers. They recommend Brighton -1.0 AH. But the given line is -0.75. Comparing implied probabilities: 1.89 translates to about 52.9% chance. If models like Dimers [15] give Brighton a 53.6% chance, that's close. Maybe slight value. Also, West Ham's away form is poor\u2014only 3 wins in 15. Brighton's defensive issues but strong attack. Maybe the handicap is justified. The analysis should balance these factors.\n\nKey player matchups. Mitoma vs Wan-Bissaka. Mitoma has 7 goals, good xG stats [9][12]. Wan-Bissaka's defensive stats? From [14], he has 2 assists but maybe defensive stats aren't highlighted. Paqueta vs Dunk: Dunk is key for Brighton's defense. Paqueta's creativity vs Dunk's aerial ability. Also, Welbeck vs Todibo/Kilman. Welbeck's 9 goals [14], Todibo new to West Ham? Not sure, but need to check.\n\nTeam news: Using the provided lineups. Brighton missing Joao Pedro due to suspension [11], which is a big loss. Also, Lamptey, Veltman injured. West Ham's lineup has Wan-Bissaka and Scarles\u2014maybe defensive changes. Need to mention how suspensions affect Brighton's attack and defense.\n\nBetting insights. Both teams to score: Brighton's BTTS is 70%, West Ham 61% [5]. Odds for BTTS yes are 1.70 in [1], but [5] says -135 (approx 1.74). If the model suggests high chance, that's value. Over 2.5 goals: both teams have defensive issues. Brighton's xG in last matches is high [6]. Maybe over 2.5 is good. Also, corners: Brighton averages 4.8 at home [4], West Ham 11 in last 5. Over 9.5 corners? [4] mentions it. Maybe that's a bet.\n\nPrediction: Brighton 2-1. They create chances but defense is shaky. West Ham can score but away form is poor. Confidence 7/10.\n\nMy Say: Need to highlight the clash of styles\u2014Brighton's possession vs West Ham's counters. Mitoma's flair, Welbeck's experience. Mention the stakes for European spots for Brighton, West Ham fighting relegation? Wait, West Ham is 17th but 15 points above drop, so maybe not. Focus on Brighton's push. Use vivid language.\n\nCitations: Each fact needs a source. For example, Brighton's winless run [1], xG stats [6], Mitoma's goals [9][12], BTTS stats [5], etc. Make sure every data point is cited correctly with the right source indices.\n\nCheck if all guidelines are followed: use sourced info, correct odds, decimal format, avoid lists, structure as JSON. Also, ensure Asian Handicap analysis considers the -0.75 line correctly. The value might be marginal, but if the model's probability is higher than implied, it's a value bet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Brighton host West Ham at the Amex Stadium in a crucial Premier League clash, with both teams seeking redemption after recent disappointments.
