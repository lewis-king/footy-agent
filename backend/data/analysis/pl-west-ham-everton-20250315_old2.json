    "match_overview": "Everton host West Ham at Goodison Park in a crucial mid-table clash between two teams separated by goal difference. The Toffees enter on an 8-game unbeaten league run under David Moyes [3][5], while West Ham aim to rebound after a narrow 1-0 loss to Newcastle ended their 2-game winning streak [3]. Recent H2H shows balanced competition with 2 wins each and 1 draw in their last 5 meetings [2][4], including a 0-0 stalemate in November 2024 [2]. Everton's defensive resilience (1.27 goals conceded/game) [6] faces a test against West Ham's counter-attacking threat led by Bowen and Kudus [7]. With both teams eyeing a potential climb to 13th place [3], tactical discipline and set-piece execution could prove decisive.",

    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed betting analysis for the Everton vs. West Ham Premier League match based on the provided search results and the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the query and the data given.\n\nFirst, the user wants a structured JSON output with specific sections like match overview, asian handicap analysis, key player matchups, team news, betting insights, prediction, and a journalist-style conclusion. They emphasized using up-to-date facts from the search results and avoiding base knowledge. So, I need to extract relevant info from the provided sources.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1] (Dimers.com)**: Gives Everton a 46.1% win probability, West Ham 28.3%, and a 25.6% chance of a draw. Predicted score 1-1. Recent form for Everton might be better since they're on an unbeaten run.\n\n2. **Source [2] (Scoutingstats.ai)**: Everton's recent form is 1-4-0 (W-D-L) in last 5 matches, scoring 8 goals. West Ham's form is 2-0-3, scoring 4 goals. Their model predicts Everton 1.3 - West Ham 1.0, under 2.5 goals.\n\n3. **Source [3] (WHUFC.com)**: Mentions Everton's 8-game unbeaten league run under Moyes. West Ham lost to Newcastle but had two prior wins. Moyes vs. Potter dynamic.\n\n4. **Source [4] (MyBets.today)**: Everton has 64% chance to win, under 2.5 goals at 69%. Recent form: Everton 4W, 4D, 2L in last 10; West Ham 3W, 1D, 6L. Both teams to score 'No' at 61%.\n\n5. **Source [5] (Opta Analyst)**: Mentions Everton's unbeaten run of 7 league games, Wolves vs. Everton context. Not directly relevant but confirms Everton's form.\n\n6. **Source [6] (Footystats)**: Everton's xG is 1.20 for, 1.50 against. Home xG 1.37, away 1.04. West Ham's stats not here, but Everton's defensive stats matter.\n\n7. **Source [7] (WhoScored.com)**: Team news: Everton missing several players (Calvert-Lewin, McNeil, etc.), West Ham's Paqueta might return. Predicted lineups as given in the query.\n\n8. **Source [8] (Betimate)**: Everton's odds 2.10, West Ham 3.30. Under 2.5 goals at 1.04. Recent H2H: 2 wins each, 1 draw last 5.\n\n**Match Overview**: Need to combine team forms, recent performances, H2H, and context. Everton's unbeaten run (8 games per source [3]), West Ham's mixed form (2 wins, 0 draws, 3 losses in last 5). Moyes' impact on Everton. Head-to-head is even (2 wins each, 1 draw last 5). Venue: Goodison Park, which is mentioned in multiple sources.\n\n**Asian Handicap Analysis**: The line is -0.25 for Everton. Need to assess if Everton covering that makes sense. Source [1] gives Everton higher win probability but also a draw chance. Source [4] suggests Everton's home form and West Ham's away struggles. However, West Ham's recent away wins at Arsenal and Leicester (source [3]) complicate things. Value might be on West Ham +0.25 given Everton's draws and West Ham's ability to get results away.\n\n**Key Player Matchups**: Beto (Everton's striker) vs West Ham's defense (Todibo, Kilman). Jarrod Bowen (West Ham) vs Mykolenko. Midfield battle between Garner/Gueye and Alvarez/Soucek. Use xG data from source [6] (Everton's xG for 1.37 at home) and West Ham's xG against (source [4] lists 1.14 xG against). Beto's physicality vs Todibo's aerial ability. Bowen's pace against Mykolenko.\n\n**Team News**: Use predicted lineups from query. Injuries: For Everton, Calvert-Lewin, McNeil, Broja, Ndiaye out (source [7]). West Ham missing Antonio, Fullkrug, Summerville (source [7]). Paqueta might return but Coufal's status (source [7]).\n\n**Betting Insights**: \n1. Under 2.5 Goals: Multiple sources ([1], [2], [4]) suggest low-scoring game. Everton's recent games have under 2.5 (source [4] says 50% over, but model predicts under). Odds around 1.80-1.90 (source [1] total 2.5 at +128/-149, which converts to ~2.28 for over and ~1.67 for under. Need to check source [4] which says under 2.5 at 69% so odds might be around 1.86. But user provided Asian Handicap odds, not totals. Need to state accurate odds based on sources. Source [8] has under 2.25 at 0.86, which is decimal odds around 1.86.\n\n2. Both Teams to Score - No: Source [4] says 61% chance. Everton's clean sheets (source [2] 0 in last 5), but West Ham's 3 clean sheets in last 5. Conflicting data. But models suggest BTTS No.\n\n3. Asian Handicap West Ham +0.25: Given Everton's draw tendency and West Ham's away form, taking the +0.25 at 2.12 could offer value. If it's a draw, half stake refunded.\n\n4. Correct Score 1-1: Source [1] predicts 12% probability. Maybe a small stake.\n\n**Prediction**: 1-1 draw. Everton's solid defense but missing key attackers; West Ham's resilience away.\n\n**My Say**: Highlight Moyes vs. Potter, Everton's farewell to Goodison Park, tactical midfield battle, and the stakes for mid-table positioning. Use vivid language to set the scene.\n\nNow, structure all this into the required JSON format, making sure to cite sources properly with [n] notations. Check for accuracy in stats and odds, and ensure all data is sourced from the provided results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Everton host West Ham at Goodison Park in a crucial mid-table clash between two teams separated by goal difference.
