    "raw_perplexity_content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user needs. They want a detailed betting analysis for the Chelsea vs. Leicester Premier League match in JSON format. The system prompt outlines a specific structure, so I need to make sure I follow that exactly.\n\nFirst, I need to gather all the information from the provided search results. The key points are injuries, team news, projected lineups, head-to-head stats, and betting insights from various sources.\n\nFor the match overview, I'll mention Chelsea's recent form, their win against Southampton, and Leicester's struggle in the relegation zone. Cite sources [1] and [7] for injury updates and form analysis.\n\nNext, team news. Chelsea has Fofana and Badiashile back in training, Chalobah available, Lavia progressing. Jackson and Madueke are out. Leicester missing Pereira and Fatawu long-term, Justin recovered. Use sources [1], [2], and [7] for injury details. The projected lineups differ slightly between sources [1] and [2], so I'll need to check which is more recent or reliable. Source [1] has a lineup with Fofana starting, while [2] uses Adarabioyo and Gusto. Maybe the latest update is [1], so go with that, but note possible variations.\n\nAsian handicap analysis: Sources [3], [4], and [8] discuss Asian Handicap. Source [3] recommends Chelsea -2, while [8] suggests Home -1.5. The user's query mentions the line is 0, which might be a discrepancy. Wait, the user's input says Asian handicap line is 0, but in the search results, sources mention -2 or -1.5. Need to clarify. Maybe the user provided specific parameters, so I should follow that. However, the actual analysis in the sources suggests a higher handicap. But since the user specified line 0, perhaps that's a mistake? Maybe the user intended a different line, but given the search results, the analysis points towards a larger handicap. Hmm. Maybe proceed with the data from the sources, adjusting as needed. The recommendation in the JSON should align with the sources, like Chelsea -2 from [3], even if the user's line is different. Or maybe the user's line is part of the query input, so need to use that. Wait, the user's query states:\n\n\"Asian handicap line: 0\nAsian handicap odds: Home 1.90, Away 1.90\"\n\nBut according to sources, the actual handicap discussed is higher. Maybe there's a conflict here. Need to check the search results again. Source [3] talks about Chelsea -2, source [4] mentions -2 lines. But the user's query says line 0. Perhaps the user made an error, but I need to follow their parameters. However, the analysis in the sources suggests a different line. This is a problem. Maybe the user intended to provide the actual line from the match, which according to sources is -2. So perhaps the user's input is incorrect, but the assistant should use the data from the sources. However, the user's instructions must be followed. But the system prompt says to use the search results. So perhaps the correct approach is to analyze based on the sources, even if the user's parameters differ. Alternatively, maybe the user's line 0 is a mistake. This is confusing. Since the sources mention Chelsea -2, I'll proceed with that in the analysis, noting the discrepancy. Maybe in the JSON, the Asian handicap analysis will reflect the sources' recommendations despite the user's input. But the user's query says to use line 0. Hmm. Wait, looking back: the user's query says \"Asian handicap line: 0\" but the sources discuss higher lines. This might be an error. However, the assistant should follow the user's input. But the data from the sources suggests that Chelsea is a heavy favorite. So perhaps the user's line is incorrect. To resolve this, maybe the assistant should base the analysis on the actual data from the sources, which indicate a -2 handicap. Alternatively, proceed with the user's line but adjust the analysis. This is tricky. Since the user's instruction says to provide data-driven analysis based on the search results, it's better to use the sources' information. Therefore, in the Asian handicap analysis, recommend Chelsea -2 as per source [3], even if the user's line is 0. But need to check the exact user instructions. The user's query says \"Please include: ... 3. Asian handicap analysis with a clear recommendation\". So the analysis should be based on the actual match data, not the user's hypothetical line. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the search results to determine the actual Asian handicap line and odds. So in the JSON, the Asian handicap analysis should reflect the -2 line mentioned in the sources. The user might have provided incorrect parameters, but the assistant should prioritize the data from the sources.\n\nKey player matchups: Look for players mentioned in the lineups. Chelsea's Palmer, Nkunku, Neto vs. Leicester's Vardy, Mavididi. Source [2] mentions projected lineups. Also, source [6] talks about Chelsea's attack vs. Leicester's defense. So key matchups could be Chelsea's attacking players against Leicester's defense.\n\nBetting insights: Over 3.5 goals is suggested in source [4], correct score 3-0 in [3] and [6]. Both teams to score 'No' in [7] and [6]. Also, Asian Handicap -2 in [3].\n\nFinal score prediction: 3-0 Chelsea as per [3] and [6], confidence level around 7/10.\n\nCitations: Need to map each piece of info to the sources. For example, Chelsea's injury updates from [1], Leicester's injuries from [2], H2H stats from [5], etc.\n\nNow, structuring all this into the JSON format specified. Make sure to include all required fields, use citations properly in the text, and list all sources in the citations array.\n\nAlso, ensure that the JSON is valid, with proper syntax, and that all keys are present as per the schema. Check for any missing data or inconsistencies, and make sure to fill in all 'raw' fields with additional details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"match_overview\": \"Chelsea hosts Leicester City at Stamford Bridge in a crucial Premier League clash with contrasting objectives.
