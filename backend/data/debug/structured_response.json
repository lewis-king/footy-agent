  "overview": "Gameweek 29 is a blank gameweek with only 8 fixtures, creating significant squad challenges due to absences from Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa, and Crystal Palace. Key matches include **Nottingham Forest vs Ipswich** (target for clean sheets), **Leicester vs Manchester United** (Bruno Fernandes' explosive form), and **Bournemouth vs Brentford** (high-scoring potential). Free Hit is strongly advised for managers with multiple blanks, while differentials like Kluivert (6.9%) and Tavernier (0.4%) offer massive upside.",
