Okay, let's tackle this FPL Gameweek 28 advice request. The user provided their team and wants personalized JSON-formatted recommendations. First, I'll need to analyze their current squad. They have two goalkeepers: Sanchez from Chelsea and Ramsdale from Arsenal. Sanchez has a home game against Leicester, which might be a good fixture since Leicester's defense is leaky. Ramsdale is probably not starting, so Sanchez is the clear choice here.

Looking at defenders, they have Trent Alexander-Arnold, who's a great pick against Southampton. Wan-Bissaka from Man Utd is facing Arsenal, which is a tough fixture. Aina from Forest is up against Man City, which isn't ideal, and Robinson from Fulham against Brighton. Maybe suggest replacing Aina with someone like Munoz from Palace, who has a good fixture against Ipswich.

Midfielders include Mbeumo, Palmer, Sancho, Iwobi, and Semenyo. Palmer is a must-keep against Leicester. Mbeumo has a tough fixture against Villa, but he's in form. Maybe suggest selling Sancho or Iwobi for a differential like Nkunku from Chelsea if he's fit, or Kluivert from Bournemouth.

Forwards are Isak, Wissa, and Cunha. Isak is a strong option if fit. Wissa might not be the best pick against Villa. Cunha has Everton, which could be good. Maybe recommend keeping Isak and Cunha but consider a differential forward like Nketiah from Palace if Mateta is injured.

Captain picks: Salah is a top choice against Southampton, but the user doesn't have him. They have Palmer, who's a good alternative. Also, Munoz as a differential captain. But the user's team doesn't have Salah, so maybe suggest transferring him in if possible.

Key fixtures: Liverpool vs Southampton, Chelsea vs Leicester, Palace vs Ipswich. These have high-scoring potential. 

Team insights: Their defense has some tough fixtures (Aina vs City, Wan-Bissaka vs Arsenal). Suggest transferring out Aina for Munoz. Midfield is okay, but could use an upgrade. Maybe sell Sancho for a cheaper midfielder to free up funds for Haaland if needed. 

Chips: They have Free Hit and Wildcard. Probably save Wildcard for later, maybe use Free Hit if they need major changes, but with 5 free transfers, maybe just make transfers instead.

Need to ensure all picks are under 10% ownership for differentials. Check the search results for mentions of low-ownership players like Nkunku, Kluivert, Nketiah. Also, cite sources where applicable in the JSON structure without markdown. Make sure the JSON is valid and follows the structure provided.
