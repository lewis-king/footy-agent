Alright, let's break down how to approach this FPL Gameweek 28 advice for the given team. First, I need to understand the user's team structure, available chips, and current resources. They have 5 free transfers and a budget of 3.7m, which is substantial. The chips available are Assistant Manager, Free Hit, and Wildcard, so chip strategy is a key consideration here.

Looking at the players, the goalkeepers are Sanchez and Ramsdale. Sanchez isn't starting anymore, so that's an immediate issue. Ramsdale is from Arsenal, who have a tough fixture against Man Utd. The defense has TAA, which is good, but others like Wan-Bissaka and Aina might not be optimal. Midfield has strong picks like Palmer and Mbeumo, but Sancho and Iwobi might be underperforming. Forwards include Isak, who's great, but Wissa and Cunha might need reviewing.

The search results mention using Free Hit in GW29 to navigate blanks, but since the user has Free Hit available, maybe suggest holding it for then. Also, key fixtures like Liverpool vs Southampton and Palace vs Ipswich are highlighted. Players like Salah, TAA, and Palace defenders are recommended.

For the current team, replacing Sanchez is a priority. Suggest a keeper like Henderson or Alisson. Defense could use more Palace coverage, maybe Munoz. Midfield is solid, but differentials like Kluivert or Nketiah could be options. Captaincy should focus on Salah or Palmer given their fixtures.

Transfers should address weak spots: Sanchez out for a starting keeper, maybe Aina out for a Palace defender. Use the 5 transfers wisely to optimize for GW28 and plan for blanks in 29. Chip advice would be to save Free Hit for GW29 and consider Wildcard later. The starting XI should maximize players with good fixtures, like Liverpool and Palace assets.
